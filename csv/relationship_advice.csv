"There‚Äôs a guy at my workplace who excessively jokes with me. Every sentence is some sort of joke. Usually when people joke around they throw a one or two liner but he made 8 jokes one after the other. My two other colleagues were face palming and shaking their heads. 

How should I behave towards him? Should I laugh at his jokes? Does he like me? He also lent me his laptop one time and is quite responsive to me but he could just be nice? He has a girlfriend so I don‚Äôt want to interfere."
"my boyfriend‚Äôs relative (around the same age as us) suddenly died yesterday after hitting his head on concrete. they were really close and his relative meant a lot to him. they were even going to hangout this weekend. 

i haven‚Äôt really dealt with death before besides my grandpa, so i am unsure of what to say to him. i let him know that I‚Äôm here for him and i support him. i tried to listen instead of saying those cliche lines. what else should i do or say? i was thinking of baking something like a pie for his family, or is that too much? 

i also wanted to buy my boyfriend things like candy he likes or little gifts. is that a good idea? im struggle with being emotionally open with other people and im awkward with this type of stuff. do i write a card or send flowers? please help me!"
" I dont have asperger's but i have a physical disability which led me to a life in a bubble.  
Or lets just say i dont know how fertility works since id die a virgin.

Im sure tho that they want the baby asap as well since my sister had finished her training  
and they live together now for idk, 6 months

tl;dr: what do i write? thats a pretty short read"
"Exactly what the title says. We went out for ice cream after a movie and it turns out he really didn‚Äôt wanna go. I had no idea as he didn‚Äôt voice this until later. He said I forced him to come and it upset me and I was hella confused. 
It ended with him telling me that it‚Äôs just something guys do. 
Things that they don‚Äôt wanna do to make the girlfriend happy. 
How do I proceed knowing this info? It‚Äôs never come up in 2 years. I‚Äôd have no idea he doesn‚Äôt wanna do things.. he plays everything as if he wants to do it."
"She's a really wonderful person who babysits very often, which is nice and all but we have both talked previously before about having a child of our own."

"Currently in relationship and looking at a hotel date for a night out and to spice things up a bit. What are your experiences with these and how do you go about it. Read some stuff about going there separately, staying in and drinking, going to bars even role-playing. Just looking to hear your experiences"
"Recently my GF(21) startede being more distant, stopped sending me goodnight texts (like she always used to), don't always respond to ""I love you"", and just feeling a little bit off .. We have been together for a little over one year. Is this because the ""honeymoon phase"" is getting over? I dont feel like that from my part. I miss when she used to be obsessed with me, she dont make me feel that way anymore .. I dont think the small things should dissapear just because ome have been together for a while. thoughts? Is she getting tired of the relationship?"
"Ok, so this is stupid but it‚Äôs real. 
I‚Äôve been friends with a guy for like 2 or 3 years and it all started in a flirty way but he lives in another country, so we kept it as friends. 
Now I‚Äôm in a relationship and I‚Äôm actually happy in it. 
The thing is lately I‚Äôve realized I think a lot about my far away friend and it gives me goosebumps to just see a picture of him. Nothing has happened between us, but I think he feels the same way. 
I really care for him and think he‚Äôs so smart and blows my brain away with everything he says. 
I feel kinda bad to feel this way towards someone else because I‚Äôm already with a partner and it‚Äôs stupid to daydream about someone who I will probably 99.99999% never meet. 
I just feel confused and don‚Äôt know what to do."
"is it bad to be in a relationship and lust over someone else. i asked him if he watched porn and he said yes , does he actually love me i don‚Äôt know what to do"
"It's honestly just getting to the point where every day is a struggle im constantly on egg shells. She's has GAD, BPD and depression. I seriously do the best I can do cater to anything. 

I honestly feel like a relationship (atleast with me) is the last thing she needs. I'm afraid to break up with her though, what if it's just the cause of her illness that she treats me like this, and not actually her. Im afraid if I leave her she'll get worse."
"Me (27F) and my bf (28M) are in a relationship for 2 years now and we have a basic but fundamental issue. We can't basically show excitement on each others' interests. We love each other we really do but few of our interests are not common and it kinda makes me sad when I can't show interest on his hobbies or his topics of interest. I love spending time with him and all, it's just i dont want to listen about them and it makes him sad he wants me to listen everything about him and be excited about them. What do i do? It's really bothering that the things excite him bore the hell out of me. He is trying to listen and be excited but he fails too so i dont mention about my interests to him."
"This is like the third time my girl has said we need a break in 1.5years of dating. Idk if she says this out of anger or not, but I‚Äôm tired of it. We literally click right back the next day or so? Why do girls do the whole ‚ÄúI‚Äôm done‚Äù ‚ÄúI need a break‚Äù thing if they just end up running right back to you?"
"Long story short, I‚Äôve led my friend to believe that I‚Äôd be interested in talking to her friend but I found out what she looks like and I‚Äôm not really too interested anymore D: ... I‚Äôm trying to get out of this situation so what do I need to say to my friend. (We aren‚Äôt exactly close btw)"
"Heyo,

I need a bit of help. I met my girlfriend a few weeks ago and we kicked it off quite well. I found out she has a TikTok with a hefty amount of guys hitting on her in the comments. I don't really know what to do here. I don't really like the fact that so many dudes are messaging her. I really like spending time with her but I'm afraid she might leave for some dude who messages her. Should I confront her about this? Please help me out here üôè"
"I [18F] was sitting on my bed topless when my door started being opened by my dad. I live with my dad. I shouted that I don't have a bra on but he came in anyway.

He immediately looked at my boobs which I then covered with my hands and he said ""don't be so shy its just me"" then he told me that he's leaving for the day and walked out of my room. He has never done this before. It made me really uncomfortable.

I didn't like him coming in after I told him I was not wearing a bra. I did not like him looking at me and talking to me when I was topless. I did not like him telling me to not be shy.

How should I discuss this with him?

tl;dr My father barged in on me when I was topless and I told him I was topless to talk to me"
"So recently my SO and I  gotten into a heated argument, she and I haven't spoken for a few days and she recently told me that she needs time and she'll talk to me when she is ready. What do I do?"
"Im always the one who initiates the conversation on my gf. When i chat her she chats back when i call her, she answers but if i try to not chat or call her for a day she wouldn't chat or call at all. What should i do?"
she broke up witth me a few days ago and she still contacts me and today she told me she loves me as a friend but then she sent the song i love you by billie eillish idk what to think does she really just love me as a friend
Is it ok to be used to your SO‚Äôs suicidal thoughts and not get really upset over it?
"I‚Äôm in dental school, and there‚Äôs this cute girl in my section of lab (we‚Äôre both 23). Today, we had to take photos of each other, and I noticed that she kept looking at me. Normally I wear glasses, but I took them off. Later in the afternoon, she told me I looked different without my glasses and asked why I took them off. I didn‚Äôt really recall taking them off until looking back through the photos of myself. Then she said that it was a rude question and apologized. She‚Äôs a super sweet and nice girl.

Am I reading too much into this, or was she checking me out? We‚Äôre friendly, but don‚Äôt hang out outside of school."
my 15m ex of 1 year whose also 15 is now suffering from a lung collapse as a result of birth defects. I don't know what to do. If I go over board it'll be weird since we aren't together anymore but if I don't do anything I'll seem like an ass hole esp if her condition deterioates. Also no visitors at all due to covid not even family. Shes not checking her phone. She's on oxygen therapy rn. It has happened before but that was before we started dating. We ended things as friends
"Am I wasting my time here.. I have been dating my bf (27) for 7 1/2 years. We have talked about getting married four years ago , and there‚Äôs always something that gets in the way.

I have bought a total of two wedding dresses and planned a wedding (small reception in 2018) 
And it all fell through, lack of team work I guess..

Well now I can‚Äôt seem to not think about it I have gotten behind in my masters program, and have had a hard time keeping motivated when my relationship is always lingering around in my head..


Don‚Äôt know if I‚Äôm wasting my time , I‚Äôve been depressed and am trying not to let myself go emotionally..."
"We meet a little over a year ago, while she had/have a boyfriend. She tells me she loves me and talking about a future, but she has no plans in breaking up with the guy she's living with. I'm just mentally drained and tired. I don't trust her at all anymore. i know that she is lying to me.

Should I just end it?"
"I keep trying to break off a friend who insists he wants to turn back time to what we used to be and insists on being friends, also exaggerates that he did a lot for me and it makes me really uncomfortable that he cannot just understand i dont want him in my life/i want to be alone. He keeps blaming himself when its not really his fault and i just want him to break it off with me because i just want to be alone. How can i convey this without making him feel he was at fault and make him realize its normal to feel like you want to break off friendships? Any advice would be welcome, thanks"
"Hello, 
I need help. My boyfriend and I are having conflicting views on children. He wants 1 kid. I love kids but I‚Äôve never considered having any. 
We have been together for 6 years. He‚Äôs the absolute love of my life but we‚Äôre having conflicting views.. 
what should I do?"
"Yesterday, my gf notice that her grandma it's very sad and it seems that she had lost her will to live. My gf lost her father and some family members in the last few years, she told me that she is not prepared to deal with the death of her grandma. 

Since I was kid I lost many family members, so those events made me see death as something natural and inevitable, and I'm too cold dealing with that. 

I want to be a support for my gf and not leave her dealing with this alone. 

I think that talking with her and be open to listen anything anytime it's not enough. Since I'm very cold I suck with the words...

Should I try to distract my gf? Should I remark that I'll be there for her?

Any advice will be awesome.

Thanks."
"If you're actually trying to make an effort in trying to make a relationship work with someone you love, why did you cheat?"
I dont want to be friends anymore with someone but they keep insisting that they want to turn back time or something which makes me uncomfortable. I dont understand why they cant realize that i want to be without them. How do i say or convey this to someone so they can mever bother me/stop talking???
"Hi, I'm writing this late at night because I feel completely hopeless, a few days ago I had an argument with my husband because he got very upset because a long-time friend spoke to me, that led to a dispute that continued for a day (of his part) days ago he told me that he had a slight pain in his friend so today he tells me that he thinks it is a sexually transmitted disease (he is a doctor) he says that he plans to sue me if so, besides speaking he told me that I was fat (I gained about 6 kilos in these months due to my depression) he told me that my feelings towards him were stupid, that he was no longer a little girl and that he had to mature (I am 20f) to clarify he has been the only couple of that type that I have had in my life and I have not had physical contact with anyone else."
It's always the other side of the story when it comes to infidelity and I wonder what the people who cheated on someone they loved felt after right after they had done it.
"Anyone that thinks they may have developed relationship anxiety , what r some ways to make it better, not overthink everything?"
Is looking thought you‚Äôre s/o liked stuff ok or would it just bring out insecurities and make me wonder about stuff I shouldn‚Äôt be worrying abt if I hadn‚Äôt looked in the first place
i just got asked put by a girl but i like someone else and i want to tell her im not interested in her but i dont want to break her heart by doing so . because me and this girl have been friends for a long time and i dont want to ruin our friendship by rejecting her so what do i do ??? im 14 and she is aswell i dont want to lose her but im interested in a different girl ... she is 15
"Because I am not happy with our relationship anymore. Our relationship isn't going as well as I'd like. Last Sunday we got together but I feel like there is no spark anymore. He can't genuinely make me smile even he's trying. And I feel bad for what I felt because I know this is not right. We almost 3 years in a relationship. I am not happy but it is hard for me to leave him or let him go. However if it is not going well for the both of us, I am thinking I should leave asap. It is tough, but getting out of it is I think the best for us if we can't be happy anymore. Should I?"
"Wishing myself a happy anniversary!

It‚Äôs my wife and I‚Äôs 2 year anniversary! Been together 6 years now in total. Can‚Äôt believe she has put up with me for so long. We‚Äôve had our ups and downs but have never been in a real serious argument/fight. We always sit down and talk it out. Sometimes it takes a few hours and some alone time but it‚Äôs all worth it. She is such an amazing wife and mother to our 2 boys. I don‚Äôt know how she does it. If you‚Äôd like to buy us a drink tonight! : Cashapp: $mkbarton2010 Venmo: @michaelbarton2010"
" My(56F) daughter 'Liz'(26F) recently started dating her boyfriend 'Ethan'(27M). I do not like her boyfriend because he is a weeb and that goes against my Christian beliefs. Liz also dresses like an anime girl these days which I think is disrespectful. I told her that, and she got really upset at me.  Should I apologize? She can date who she wants but surely I shouldn't have to pretend I like it."
"I would never cheat on my girlfriend, it‚Äôs just not the kind of guy I am. But recently she‚Äôs been extremely annoying and I can‚Äôt help but get horny and dreaming about sexting other girls. Girls I know, random girls, anyone. I haven‚Äôt actually done it but I deathly want to. Any suggestions?"
"My due date is approaching I‚Äôm just at a lose of what to do, do I let him in? Would I be spiteful not to? 
He‚Äôs really hurt me he‚Äôs left me for another woman while I‚Äôm 7 months pregnant. Has anyone been in this situation if so what do you do?"
"So she‚Äôs 19 and i‚Äôve just turned 18 this month, she‚Äôs picking me up tomorrow night after work to go on a ‚Äúdrive‚Äù i‚Äôve never had car sex so i don‚Äôt actually really know to initiate it or end up in the back seat, let alone if she actually wants car sex, all we‚Äôve talked about is our spotify playlist and our singing for the drive, i‚Äôve not asked any sexual questions or even made that my intentions as i really don‚Äôt think she‚Äôs that ‚Äútype‚Äù of girl to be sexual over text and i don‚Äôt want to be that kinda guy either right now, i‚Äôve only known her a week. Do you think ‚Äúa drive‚Äù means car sex? and how would i go about initiating it if it felt right ?"
How have you guys won your SO back after they‚Äôve told you they‚Äôve fallen out of love and what mistakes did you make?
"With the lockdown, its not possible for us to meet, and its been really hard, her whole family was tested positive, and it was on her to look after them, and now with her grandfather, I just wanna say ot do something to make her feel better"
"Hey yall. I don‚Äôt post much, but I‚Äôm 22 and never been in any kind of situation. People tell me I‚Äôm good looking, I have a degree, and Im well mannered for the most part. I‚Äôm tired of hearing the ‚Äúyou‚Äôll find one‚Äù cliche because thats dismissive of the issue imo. What Can i do?"
"So we have a two year old daughter, long story short my gf got off methadone and has been crazy for 3 weeks now in and off. Well today her mom came over and we had an ok time, long story short we got into an argument and she headed to the knife drawer and pulled one out so I grabbed her by the neck and slammed her against the stove. She stabbed me with her right hand, hit my left neck area and then slice dm the other side of my neckZ id post pics but idk how. 

I honestly told her I‚Äôd forget about it, but she‚Äôs still talk mad shit. I documented pics of her with drugs too. I want to stay together but the stabbing was it. 


What should I do?"
"I'm considered a relatively smart kid (not tryin to brag but it shows) and my gf is well aware of it. The problem is, for some reason, she really hates it when I do things better than her, like she wants to beat me at smth. Even doe it's smth I've been practicing for years, she challenges me with the thought that she could beat me at it and when she loses, she gets really upset, is there any way for me to deal with this? She's quite emotional but I understand that part of her, I really just want to make her happy."
"and serious about accomplishing the goals we have set. And just to set the stage I am an overthinker lol. So, my worry is she hasn‚Äôt gotten me a ring yet and this is something that is a little bothersome. Am I perhaps reading to much into this? Could it be that she is looking for a ring and I just do not know it? Idk I‚Äôm hoping I can get some clarity from you all that have experienced this."
"My friend met this girl on a trip they both chaperoned for. The girl is super cool and down to earth, so my friend asked for her number. Things are ok. He‚Äôs not sure how much she‚Äôs into him. It‚Äôs really no big deal if she isn‚Äôt. My friend has encountered rejection, but he wants the highest probability for success on this. A best foot forward kind of approach. If she‚Äôs not into him or not interested in hanging out it‚Äôs no big deal he just want to give it a shot.

He wants to take her kayaking cause she loves being outside and doing physical activities. How can he ask her without putting to much pressure on the situation. They‚Äôve only known each other for 5 days. Thought everyone should know that."
does instagram send a notification that a message has been unsent? i sent something to my boyfriend that in hindsight is really dumb but if he says i unsent it he'll most likely ask me what it was
"So in February I broke my girlfriend trust. I didn't cheat on her physically but I did say things to this girl that use to stalk me and I was planning to get back at this stalker for messing up my last relationship. Stupid idea right ? Yeah I know Anyway that plan backfired. The stalker girl messaged her and told her And basically I broke her trust.  

I been working to fix it every single day from February until today . But she brings it up over and over and over . It gets so annoying.  I know I fucked up but she keeps kicking me while I'm down. We still go on dates and have sex , FaceTime.  She still has her doubts in me . She doesn't fully believe me. 
What can I do from stopping her from bringing up thr situation."
I (f19) just broke up with my boyfriend (m22) of two years after I found he made a tinder profile recently. I looked at the profile and conversations really never got past the introductions but I couldn‚Äôt take it. I really do love him and want the rest of my life with him and he wants the same but I can‚Äôt trust him right now so I broke it off. I said there‚Äôs nothing he can do right now but haven‚Äôt completely closed the door on getting back one day down the line. What would you do if it was someone you truly loved?
"My live in bf ignores me for games constantly. He will play for hours on end. He will even suggest we spend time together and then get lost in a game again. And when I get upset be like, idk what we would do anyways. 

He will play video games with my 9year old, which is fine. But he doesnt even think to ask me. 

He will talk about games to me constantly. But if I try to speak it's like talking to a freaking wall. 

At this point I sent in a corner and read all day alone."
"Hey all, I need help. I‚Äôm (19M) and I‚Äôm dating an older girl who‚Äôs been to college when I haven‚Äôt cause of the virus. She has had sex with two more people than me, I‚Äôve only had sex w her and one other girl, and it‚Äôs bothering me a lot and I can‚Äôt help obsessing over it all the time because of my OCD. This is the girl I wanted to marry but I genuinely don‚Äôt know if I can get passed this. And yes she knows I think ab this but she doesn‚Äôt know how bad I think ab this. I couldn‚Äôt imagine her with another guy. I need help."
"I‚Äôve been dating my boyfriend for 2 months now, but soon I‚Äôll be moving away for the next year or so. We likely won‚Äôt be living in the same place for a year or more. 

I‚Äôve never had a successful long distance relationship before, and tbh neither of us are great at texting each other. 

What tips do you have for making a long distance relationship work?"
"I've been in a relationship for several years and become familiar with a certain kind of flirting. That being said, the relationship has ended and I'm finally ready to get back out there, but I do know how to talk to women anymore, I feel like I'm too creepy. How does one flirt with females without being that creepy guy? Maybe wrong place to ask."
"Basically as the title reads. I don't want his family to judge him, or say anything rude to him. Being emasculated isn't something he's seemed to care about, but I'm still so nervous I might offend him. Him and I have been through a lot (counseling, break ups, etc.) and we're finally in a place where I know he's my forever person, and him only being my BF just feels like it's not enough anymore. Any suggestions? Also, my previous post doesn't make him look too good, but I promise he's an amazing man who's done so much work to give me what I need (me for him as well) and I wanna be with him forever!"
"I (M)24 recently got cheated on by my girlfriend (F34) with her co worker, I caught him with his hand up her skirt while we were laying in the couch. She said she doesn‚Äôt remember it at all we were drunk and on E and  says is ashamed and all. I‚Äôm just trying to figure out how I can go about forgiving her.."
My boyfriend and I have been together for just over a year. We have been having quite a few minor arguments recently. We had the chat yesterday about the best way to go forward. He wanted to go on a break for a couple of weeks to see if he misses me. We work in the same company so how do I act to get him to want to come back to me and is it likely when a guy initiates the break that he will come back?
"I can call hits on people. At the drop of a name, my ex will go have sex with them. It is a super power I have harnessed carefully. What do I do now that I am here?"
The girl I like posted on Snapchat of her dressed up to go out with her friends. I texted her and said that her outfit was fire and that she looked awesome. She replied exactly ‚Äúthank you.üòÖ‚Äù. What does her emoji mean in that context? Not sure if I‚Äôm overthinking it but she never uses periods when we talk so I‚Äôm not sure what the meaning is.
"I'm going through a lot of stuff at home, hence my previous post. I am still not in the best shape mentally and my friend invited me over to hang out. This hang out ended up with me pinned to his bed and us making out. Not only do I feel taken advantage of but confused. I willingly didn't stop him or even try to stop him but I'm not gay or atleast I don't think I am. He knows everything that's happening in my life and then he does this! I dont know what to feel other then regret. I didnt like it in the moment I didn't do of feel anything but i went to go play video games and stuff and ended up making out in his bed."
"We are both bisexual girls, I‚Äôm 19 and she‚Äôs 21. We were hanging out in her apartment, drunk and high and she offered me to do it few times after we made out like we sometimes do. I said no the first few times but eventually I gave in.
That was my first sexual experience with a girl and honestly I feel weird about it. I don‚Äôt know how to escape the awkwardness when i see her again.
We talked about it and all, she said she‚Äôs down to do it more times if i want to and would even be in a relationship with me, but i wouldn‚Äôt be tbh. 
And I feel extremely weird about what happened and what we did.

TL;DR: I had sex with my best friend and now I don‚Äôt know how to stop feeling uncomfortable"
We're both unemployed rn and I'm currently trying to find a job. We hang out alot during the day. I just experienced a big loss in my family on top of moving across the country again living with his family we live in the same room basically and pay rent very cheap. He plays games every night and tries to be quiet but it stresses me out. I takes a toll on my depression and anxiety. It's been a long long time of this cycle and I don't have a car on this side of the country and getting to the city is hard so I've been just feeling trapped maybe it's time to just make big moves alone?
So I know this is pretty personal but basically my girlfriend and I have been together for almost a year now. she had logged into my computer and after she left my house she was still logged in. Me being me I just had to see what she had been searching. It felt wrong to do but I did it anyways. Most of it was normal things but then I saw that she searched for uncensored pictures from those Huniepop games. What should I do? I dont want to tell her that I went through her history but I want to know why. Anything helps.
It's an activity we are going to be the two of us and the tomatoes and cucumbers had to be picked anyways ? Am I not trying hard enough ? Should dates be more special ? Is this technically a hang and not a date ?
"what should I do because I like my crush and she likes me too but we both don't want to date yet

I know this sound like a really minor issue compared to some other posts on this sub but I don't know what to do so I came to Reddit for help as I do for most things. I really like this person and they like me too but we both find it awkward to date though and we both don't want to date yet but I really like her an I don't want to loose and and I want to date her in a year or so. We still talk often but I'm worried if this keeps going I'll go into 'The Friend Zone' what should I do"
"So I really like this girl and if it were any other girl than her I would interprete her signals like she‚Äôs into me, but with this girl it‚Äôs different.

 Why I think she likes me: she sits really close to me, she touches my butt and d*ck (but in a playful not very sexual way) A LOT, she has shown her boobs to me unintentionally but still not, we talk a lot and frequently

But this is why I think she doesn‚Äôt like me: she‚Äôs always mentioning other guys and what she want to do with them etc, she doesn‚Äôt write with me like she does with other guys who she like

But why does she call me whenever I‚Äôm with another girl and me and this girl is going to ‚Äúdo it‚Äù?"
so basically my girlfriend is super happy with me and the love i‚Äôve given her so far and she‚Äôs really grateful but she got out of a relationship recently (march) which i didn‚Äôt really think through and she just feels off she says. i don‚Äôt know what she‚Äôs feeling and she doesn‚Äôt really know how to explain. sorry if this isn‚Äôt enough info.
"I just feel like I'm responding way too fast to the girl I like. She's fine with it and says she prefers when I reply faster but I don't really like how I've lately been sort of like a junkie for her like I'd get that adreadline rush when my phone buzzes and stuff.

Any advice or suggestions appreciated thanks!"
Is this always attractive? Does it come off as dramatic? What do you say in these encounters? Love at first sight or pure law of attraction? Who is to know
Like what the fuck do I even do you cant just friendzone your fiance what the hell lisa
"I‚Äôve been very depressed,suicidal, and having panic attacks for the past couple months. He is the only one who knows what‚Äôs going on and he‚Äôs been very kind and supportive. I just feel like crap though and I feel like I should break up with him. I‚Äôm not good enough for him. And he shouldn‚Äôt have to take care of me. I just feel like at this point I‚Äôm going to actually go down this road and a very irrational part of me feels like breaking up with him and burning bridges will make my death easier for people.  I‚Äôm not as suicidal before. It‚Äôs been coming and going a lot lately but I still think he shouldn‚Äôt have to support me mentally and emotionally. It must be exhausting for him."
I‚Äôm at a loss and have no idea what to do or how to break it to my family that I know.
"I‚Äôve been with my girlfriend now for 6 months, I love her to death. This is her first relationship and my second, yet I still feel as if she is lying and talks to other guys when she plainly is not. I get the fear that she is cheating or lying to me and I hate it, there is no evidence of her doing these things. I constantly think these things when I‚Äôm not around her or when she does things that are off. What the fuck can I do to stop"
"I've been seeing someone for probably over a month now and he is way less frequent at communication than anyone I've dated. I've tried bringing it up a few times saying that I would like to talk more or he texts me a lot less than I'm used to but I don't know if he isnt getting it or just fine not talking everyday. I am considering ending things but I thought it would get a little better. I feel really bad not hearing anything for a day or two from him. I think I just want to try one more time and if it doesn't get better, then I don't think I can be in a relationship where we don't talk every day."
"Hi all,

My (29F) sister (30F) is going through a tough time at the moment. She has a lot in her plate in terms of work and home life, and she is the social glue of our friendship group. She's currently experiencing burn out, and I'm seeking advice as to how to support her. Has anyone else had experience in supporting family through this? What can you suggest?

Thanks."
So I‚Äôve been seeing the guy recently and things are going really well. He seemed to be everything I‚Äôve been looking for. However last night we were talking and somehow got in the topic of abortion. He said he supports women having a choice but doesn‚Äôt personally believe in it and he said he thought it‚Äôs becoming to normalized. What he doesn‚Äôt know is that I had an abortion 2 years ago. Idk this really threw me off and I‚Äôm unsure whether I should tell him about my experience or take it as a sign and move on?
We are young couples. My wife has no interest in sex at all. Do you guys know any good clinic specialize in women libido in Toronto area?
"So I recently started dating this girl. Everything is going great but she is definitely more social than I am, especially with making new friends. I‚Äôm more socially anxious so I‚Äôm more than happy for her to go be social w/out me. I trust her but im obv a little insecure if im writing this and overthink a ton, and basically I just want someone to tel me I‚Äôm overthinking cause I haven‚Äôt been able to go my therapist since this happened haha. Basically she hung out w a guy friend she hasn‚Äôt hung out w before, by themselves. She also sent me a pic of her in a basement cause it was raining. It just gives me a weird feeling in my stomach, but I just wanted someone to tell me I‚Äôm overthinking."
"i had dinner with my family and at the end i went up to the assistants cook for his social media. he gave me his snapchat and i want to text him hey or something lol... 

idk if it‚Äôs too soon the same night or if he had another shift after"
"I'm not in a relationship (maybe yet idk), but I think this one girl who works at the gym I go to is really cute and we've had little conversations lasting around 20 minutes every once and awhile. I noticed she wasn't working today when she normally does so I asked one of the employees if she was working today and then they gave me a weird look and said ""I can't give out information about other employees, would you want me to message them and ask?"" and gave me another weird look and I just said no and walked away. I feel like maybe me asking made things weird?"
"When I first met my boyfriend, we had sex. Not sure how to feel about that but even now , when I go over his place we always end up doing it. There‚Äôs never been a time we didn‚Äôt. I‚Äôm not sure what to think of this. Other than this we have a healthy relationship, have bonding time at my place and intimate time at his. Help?"
"I'm currently at home stay due to Covid, and I barely have any friends. Me and my bf have the same social circle, but he has another social circle of his own, I don't have except those mutual friends
And since I'm currently not working, it's even more difficult to create a new social group
I try to work on my hobbies, upskill myself in my major etc
But I still find myself always available around my bf except if I'm sleeping

We don't live together, and we don't go out as much anymore due to the pandemic, but we talk on the phone every single minute he's awake. 
And I know the saying: Be too available, and people start to lose interest, and miss you less. It's making me anxious! 

So how do I become less available all the time? How do I get a life of my own away from the relationship?"
I am a women who likes to sleep with more than one guy. One is just not enough. My boyfriend has KNOWN this sense we started banging but yet a year later he‚Äôs decided he‚Äôs leaving me unless I want a ‚Äúcommitted relationship‚Äù the idea that men should stop their partners from promiscuity is rooted in the patriarchy and is deeply wrong. I tried to explain that holding our relationship hostage for this is basically abuse but he wouldn‚Äôt hear me. I think he must‚Äôve been inoctinated by by 4chan or men‚Äôs rights activists or something. What should I do now? Should I try to get him back or just replace him with someone else?
"Yeah my ex just texted me pics of her new relationship. Like a relationship is meant to be bragged about all over the media. A relationship isn‚Äôt a materialistic, to me it‚Äôs a behavior. Idk it‚Äôs making me sad though. That people will randomly just start drama for no reason. I did nothing to deserve that. People are crazy. What shall I do here? I blocked her on everything but the emotional toll is heavy. Thanks!"
He makes me feel really bad for it and I don‚Äôt know if it‚Äôs right
"I don't know what to do, I feel lost. 

My partner and I are in a long distance relationship and I really do love him so much. I'm just struggling hard to stay positive for us to close the distance; Every option involves some criteria that doesn't apply to us, and I honestly just feel hopeless.
The other option is getting married soon, but I've told him I don't feel ready for that (mentally I need to mature more).

Its getting too much to handle and I need advice- should I persuit the relationship or leave now?"
"Story goes, I was talking to this guy for about a month. 4 Days ago he confessed that he likes me. This weekend he asked my plans and I told him I was invited to a friend's house. He asked me who was gonna be there and sounded very on edge. When I asked him why he was so pissy he said he was worried I'd find someone else and forget about him. Fast forward to Monday,  he took a long time texting back and today I realized he has unfriended me from all socials. We were even planning on going on a date next week.


I'm very confused on what has happened. Did I just got played üòÇüòÇüòÇAny insights?"

So her father never approved off me and he was ultimately the reason we broke up. It's been 8 months and I still can't get her out of my head. I want to ask her father why he didn't approve of me
"So we‚Äôve been together 5+ years. Been together since I was 18. I‚Äôve never lived on my own and want to do it just so I know I could do it. I don‚Äôt want to feel dependent on living/being with someone because I‚Äôm afraid of being alone. 

I know I can‚Äôt expect them to just be like ‚Äòyeah ok!‚Äô And if they found someone else in that time apart I would accept my fate. 

I just don‚Äôt even know how to begin the conversation/ if it‚Äôs even a good idea.

Have been thinking about it for months but feel very conflicted...."
"if your friend knows you‚Äôre going through a recent breakup and asks you to hangout, but makes it a date, does that make him genuine or slick?"
"I (üôãüèª‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è) have been with my significant other ( üôãüèΩ‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è) for well over 10 years....

It‚Äôs just not the same as it used to be. Do people eventually just grow apart?

We got together when we were younger and now I feel that as we move on in life, we‚Äôre just becoming more and more apart. 

Idk. Thoughts??"
"Recently I got into a fight with my gf. I let my frustration get the best of me and I was mean and called her names, but we‚Äôre good now. I apologized and we sorted things out, but I still want to maintain a good relationship with her parents. They were very good to me up until this point and just told me to treat her well. Should I call and apologize to them? and if not, what‚Äôs a good way to make sure that I stay on good terms with them as well?"
"It‚Äôs a mess and hiding all of this is very hard, I want to come clean and feeling like I‚Äôm committing a crime for being in love with a woman. 

My parents are pretty religious but my mom is lowkey gay and doesn‚Äôt know it/want to admit it because she loves god too much. Her and my dad are divorced but are on good terms so I can tell them together at once but how.... I‚Äôve been trying to tell them but the words won‚Äôt come out. 

In 5 months we‚Äôre going to move in together. 

My last relationship last 4 years and it was with a boy, it was first relationship ever too and he was so toxic and abusive to me and it was impossible to break up but once I did it I found myself super attracted to woman and I have no sexual feelings towards men whatsoever."
"We're both 19 if that matters even though she was born in 02 I'm in 01, but  anyways I'm not entirely  sure what I should think about this because I've never been in a relationship, should I take it as it is and see where the wind takes for time time being idk ?"
My fianc√© talks to some girls on one of his mobile games which I was fine with until he started talking to a friend of his girlfriend last night. When one of the players asked why the girl‚Äôs boyfriend is not playing his reply was ‚ÄúHe does not want to play with him anymore because he is never sober.‚Äù And every time someone asked him something regarding his playing skills he always answered they can ask the girl she knows how he plays. I am extremely confused at this stage and just tired. I am not sure what to make of this situation anymore.
"At some point if the girl just doesn't respond for a while I assume she is disinterested. Although that being said, she did message me 3 days ago, 4 days after my initial message, ""wanting to say hi and to ask how I was doing"".  

I never responded in spite her of ignoring my last message.

Would this personally annoy you? 

My assumption has been that it is polite to say nothing more, I mean silence is a statement right?

What do you guys think of this? Am I just being petty here. I can't figure out whether the girl wants to do the dance or not and am thinking about this far too much."
and when did you know it was the right time?
"Whenever I play on my pc, I want to focus on my game so I try to put all my attention on it or I won't play well (I have ADHD). Whenever my bf talks to me, I get extremely irritated and talk to him with attitude. He will come over for a kiss while I'm mid-fight and I would sound put off or give him a meanish look. I immediately feel lots of guilt after the game, but at the same time, I want my space. I respect when he's gaming bc I know how it feels, but he doesn't mind when I come over and talk to him while he's playing. He'd be nice still. I don't. I want to stop acting like this. What should I do?"
"Ive met this girl a while ago who is so amazing. We met online and because we didnt want e-dating to ruin our relationship, we decided to hold off on that. We still flirt and talk literally everyday and what not. Recently tho, I feel like ive started to become overly clingy to her. And I know she loves me a lot, I dont think its nearly as much as i do her. Essentially what im asking is that, I want to become less clingy and i dont know how."
they have been doing this for a while now and i don‚Äôt know if i should be worried she tells me she only has feelings for me but i over think everything i believe she still has feelings for him its slowly eating me alive i can not take this anymore i am on the edge i do not know what to do
I‚Äôm having a really hard time finding the words to tell this amazing guy that I don‚Äôt see a future between us. What‚Äôs the best way of telling him without breaking his heart?
I don't do well with long distance traveling. How do we bridge the gap?
"I work for the governemt. The goverment recently gave me a pay increase to find a place to live. I would like my wife to contribute, but she doesn't want to contribute to any bills or anything because she wants to save money for a car. Any advice"
"I have been dating a girl for 2 months, I am 19 and she is 20. It was straight out of my previous relationship but not a rebound. On one occasion I was going out with my family to dinner, we were in the car, my brother called and I was joking around saying I haven't left yet. She hit me on the shoulder and said ""Stop lying"". On another occasion, I got her shift time wrong and she said ""Do you even think?"". She is also angry that I am going away for a week with my family next week, is this abusive?

Also sorry if the spelling is bad"
"She and I have been dating for the past two years and she proposed to me . I said yes but then she said she wouldn't feel right if she didn't ask for my parents' permission to marry me first. Even though I've told her I intend to marry her anyway and we both already have jobs so neither of us needs financial support. But she still insisted and now I'm worried about my parents' response. They like my girlfriend enough but can be a bit overprotective of me ; my gf is the only one I've ever been with. I thought about just announcing our engagement without her having to ask, to show them how serious we are about this, but she disagreed. Any ideas or suggestions for what I should do?"
Me and my ex recently got back together but we both dated one other person while we took time apart and both regret it. The guy she was with tried to force himself on her and she‚Äôs horrified of the thought still. She says she has bad anxiety and she‚Äôs even scared of the dark. She cries all the time now. I get so mad when I think about it I just want to see this guy and I don‚Äôt know what then. I‚Äôm furious about it but she tells me to not get involved because she loves me too much for anything bad to happen to me. But how can I not get involved when he did that shit to her.
"4 years ago my friend (but at the time acquaintance) and his then girlfriend broke up after 2 years of dating. I believe it was because he wasn‚Äôt treating her right, but I‚Äôve never gotten clarification. (Not even really my business anyway). Afterwards, he got a new girlfriend and has been with his new girlfriend for a few years now. 

Now for about a little over a year, I have had feelings for his ex girlfriend, but I feel guilty because of it. 
Although at the time when they dated he and I weren‚Äôt close, but now we are pretty close, and we play video games almost everyday together after work. I‚Äôve tried to ignore it, but the feeling hasn‚Äôt gone away. Should I just move past this and not even try, or should I let her know how I feel, even if it upsets my friend after all this time?"
"17M

I would like to hear some pieces of advice as to what I should look for in a girlfriend. I would appreciate anyone's input"
"one of my close friends has a heart next to my name, they don‚Äôt know I saw it but I don‚Äôt know what to do can anyone help"
"we ended up our 1 year relationship because we never got time for each other, we were young back then and don‚Äôt know how to manage relationship while focusing on our education. so we said our goodbye focused more on our education. But things ended very abruptly with us and never got to end on a good note. 

it has been two years now since we ended things, and that 1 year of friendship and the years before that got lost on our break up. i want to bring back that relationship where we were just friends without the part where we were lovers.

here‚Äôs the catch tho, when it comes to socializing, it is very hard for me to get the conversation running. I‚Äôm confident enough to chat, talk to her, or call her,  but scared of not being able to make the conversation normal and friendly."
"
My boyfriend went away for a weekend with his friend quite recently, he said some girl with red hair put her hands on his chest while he was partying, and that he is attracted to red heads, he said it as if he was really excited and flustered about it to me. 


I woke up to a picture of a girl with red hair on my Instagram feed and I just got reminded , it really upset me. 
I feel like I can‚Äôt be with him anymore like usual without being upset , I obviously told him I wax offended by what he said at the time, but he shook it off as nothing."
"it‚Äôs pretty straightforward, i looked at instagram and i noticed i wasn‚Äôt following my boyfriend anymore, so i thought maybe i unfollowed him by accident but then i facetimed my friend (who was following him) and she said ‚Äúoh i‚Äôm not following him either‚Äù then i checked and none of my relatives were following him anymore either. so obviously it‚Äôs not an accident, he purposely removed us from his following. i‚Äôm not sure why but i‚Äôm freaking out. like what does he not want me to see? is he cheating? 

any input?"
"my BF [20M] and I [20F] have been dating for almost 2.5 years now. 

in the honeymoon phase we were all over each other and convinced that we had found the love of our lives and naively believed we would be together forever. 

over the last year i have slowly come to the realization that he is not ~the one~ and that i don‚Äôt think i would be able to see a long term future with him, marriage kids etc. 

I love him and love spending time with him now but just feel confused as to what to do. It feels too early to break it off but i also feel like i‚Äôm stringing him along. I know we‚Äôre both very young but the stress of it all gets to me as i worry that i‚Äôm being inauthentic in our relationship."
"I (24f) and my boyfriend (23m) have been dating about a year and a half. I‚Äôve been struggling with depression for a while but it‚Äôs been getting worse during the pandemic and with exams coming up. Sometimes I just feel like hanging out and talking but lately it‚Äôs been all about sex with him, and he thinks it will make me feel better. If I‚Äôm crying he‚Äôll suggest sex to make it better, same if I have a headache or any other problem. Is it reasonable to ask to just take a break from sex for a while?"
"My girlfriend is a bigger gal and I love her a lot, the other night we were talking and I said her weight wasn't a turn on and it want a turn off, I gave her a reason it was a turn on however now that I'm thinking I don't have a reason for it to be a turn off. Now she's convinced that I don't like her weight but I do I just didn't think what I was saying through and now when I try to explain it she says I'm lieing to her, what do I do?"
"I (24M) and my friend (24F) had plans and she wanted to change into a different top. So while in the car she began to change, but asked me close my eyes while she changed she had a bra on. While dropping her home she switched back to her original top but didn't ask me to close my eyes but I was driving so couldn't look. 
So my question, why bother doing that? üòÇ"
"A few years ago I ghosted someone once they moved away, I‚Äôm not sure why I did it but I understand completely that I‚Äôm the asshole in this situation. Since then they reached out several times over the span of a year but I never responded because I felt like it was too late. A day ago though they reached out once again letting me know who they are and where I knew them from. I absolutely want to reconnect with them because I genuinely liked them, but I have no idea what to say or how to say it. I don‚Äôt want to copy and paste a message from some strangers on the internet but I want a general idea of what I should say that doesn‚Äôt make it seem like I‚Äôm begging for pity or like it was an accident or something."
"We have been together several years and babies are the next plan, but now I am stressing about possible red flags that I am overlooking now because everything else is working well and falling into place. Am I just over thinking? I feel lost now thinking about the future. I know he will be an amazing father, but I feel our relationship together is struggling. How do I get Out of this baby fever so I can really figure out what is going on with us?"
She broke up with me because she said she was wrong and wasn‚Äôt ready for a relationship like me and I know there‚Äôs other stuff going on but now she doesn‚Äôt even want to be my friend how do I get her back. I still love and care about her so much.
"So I (24M) have been talking to a woman (24F) for 4 months. Long story short, she would sometimes mention how she never wanted me to ghost her (even tho I never did anything like that). Well recently, I think she‚Äôs in fact ghosted me. I even brought it up like ‚Äúyeah you never talk to me anymore and I feel like you‚Äôre ghosting me‚Äù but she says that‚Äôs not the case at all. But, when I text her she responds HOURS later and she didn‚Äôt used to do this. I even stopped texting first and now I never really get a text. However she still watches my social media stories. Should I just assume I‚Äôve been ghosted here? If so, how should I move forward? Unfollowing her? Blocking her? I don‚Äôt really wanna ask about the ghosting thing again because I already had that conversation."
"She was accepted to two different schools, one relatively close and another very far away. She should have made her decision a few days ago and I wanted to ask her which one she accepted. We've broken up two months ago and she seemed very adamant she does not want to get back considering her previous messages and subsequent NC. So I'm not sure if it's even worth asking but I have this burning question to ask."
I've made it quite clear to both of them that I find the amount they talk uncomfortable. They became best friends on Snapchat and has a steak of like 3 weeks suggesting to me that they talk quite regularly. I edited that it made me unconditionally but they dismissed that they were just friends and they rarely talk. Me and my girlfriend argued last night and broke up over this and I know feel really shitty. I still want to be with her but she says that she won't change to please me. She talks to guys more and gets on better with guys. I don't really have a problem with this and I was the one who told her to talk to my friend. What I don't like us how often it seems to be able it's causing a struggle.
"Who starts crying when they admit someone is their boyfriend? This isn't recent but like a few years ago, we aren't dating now. I was just confused by the situation because it happened and wanted to understand how that worked. We are just friends now, so should I warn her future partners when this happens? 

I just don't understand the juxtaposition of the text to emotional state. And as time went on she seemed genuinely happy. I just don't know what that conversation was."
"I just found out two days ago that my boyfriend of a year was in a five year relationship and seeing someone else a month ago... i even slept at his place and I never saw anything that indicated someone else lived there. I didn‚Äôt even leave until almost 1pm the next day and still didn‚Äôt see anyone. Why do men do this? Or go to the extent of saying they see a future with you or doing small romantic gestures if they‚Äôre with other people and even SAY they don‚Äôt want to see other people. Also, how do you cope with this üòÖ i‚Äôm a mess, i‚Äôm sorry"
" Hello. 22f, There is a guy I'm talking to, he did ask me out for lunch. I have a really big crush on him. Sometimes when I think of him. I do have thoughts of us having sex, and I get turned on from that. There are very vivid sexual thoughts, I believe I also have maladaptive daydreaming. Or I have thoughts of kissing and hugging him. My mind just goes there sometimes lol. I also think about him and I going on adventures together, and experiencing life. The thing is with the coronavirus, I'm more bored at home, so I have more time to have these thoughts. your thoughts on this? how normal is this? I know when we meet in person, I won't be sexual towards him until he's ready/ or wants to of course. I'm also a virgin if that matters or changes things."
"We ve been happily married and living together for half a year. She had this opportunity to go work as a nurse in Guyana so we moved together cause I could work remotely.
Few weeks pass by, she starts changing, things get worst and suddenly she asks to split up.

Now I just want to rebuild myself, focus on my future. But I am afraid I will never be able to build new relationships while I move to a completely new place. People seems to already have their own social circle and I don't know anymore how to get in there .
Any advice would be so helpful! Thanks"
"My (21) BF(20) and I were in a hotel, we were drinking. I blacked out at some point and woke up the next day with a hangover. He told me we had sex but I din't remember it happening at all... he was also drunk as well though so it shouldn't be weird, right? Am I overthinking this?

The reason I ask is because I mentioned to him how that felt a little weird, and he got angry. I also mentioned to him that I hate it when he always wants to have sex and continues to ask me even after I've said ""no"" multiple times until I just give in. He got angry over that too, and said as far as he can remember he's only done it maybe 2 times. From my perspective he's done it at LEAST 10+ times throughout our relationship."
"I sent a selfie to my girlfriend after shaving and her text reaction went:

Mmm
MMM

Does this mean she liked it?"
"I was going to send her a message sometime asking how she is, if she‚Äôs happy, and maybe to become friends again, but I don‚Äôt know how long to wait or if I should even do it because she‚Äôll probably never want to talk to me again."
"Hi guys. First time posting in here. I (19M) and my girlfriend (18F) have been having sex for awhile now. We recently hit our one year together and everything has been going great. But not saying the sex we are having is bad but I really wanna stick it in the butt. She is very against this and very terrified of the idea. I can agree with her but we don‚Äôt know what if she loves it. Now I don‚Äôt really understand why I am sort of attracted to it either it‚Äôs out of curiosity or different holes excite me. Basically my question is.. how can I influence her to let me jam it in her asshole. Thanks guys.
TDLR: I want to have some butt sex."
"My boyfriend loves gaming, and I love that he has a passion for them, but.... I think it‚Äôs a problem when I feel like moneys being thrown down the drain. He spent 100 dollars for a knife on a game... like does that seem irrational? Or should I mind my business?"
"My girlfriend and I went on a break to see our friends and it was fairly mutual. I saw her for her birthday with two other friends, she was literally acting distant then and it was strange. Secondly, I saw her this weekend and she rescheduled her plans to see me. but she didn't want to hold hands and she wasn't laughing or commenting on my jokes like normal, and she even got off at an earlier stop than me. Thirdly none of it adds up because she makes these efforts to talk to me and see me yet when I do it doesn't feel normal. I theorize maybe it's an issue at home she's dealing with but I don't know how to bring it up so I know for sure what it is. How should I address this?"
"My girlfriend of 7 months has many friends that are men. She has brought up how they all have wanted her at one point, but it isn‚Äôt like that anymore. Every weekend they go out and get drunk. Sometimes I go with them and I see that they get touchy. Is this a red flag? And how should I bring this up to her?"
"Do women say I love you first when both are divorced and in 40s? If so, is 6 months enough time?"
"I really do not feel not good enough since I saw the stuff on his phone. üôÅ 
Totally ruined my self esteem and it‚Äôs been over 6 months."
"I really like this girl and I want to ask her out but I don‚Äôt don‚Äôt have any good line, help me out please?"
"My dad has been bugging me and my sister to sleepover, we don‚Äôt live with him but see him on a regular basis. Recently he‚Äôs been trying to get us to sleep over at his house since we didn‚Äôt live with him since we were 8. To me it seems like a waste of time because I‚Äôll be sleeping and not actually hanging out with him. I can see his point of view of making up lost time but I feel like he should view me as more as a adult that would rather go to his gf house or friends to sleep over than my dads. He only lives 10 mins away so it‚Äôs not like I don‚Äôt see him. What do you guys think I should do, sleep over or, stay home?"
"I have been dating this guy for about 5 months. Things have been great. Saturday I drank too much and said and acted ways I am not proud of. We talked about it Sunday and he said he will give me another chance but he is not going to put up with it. 
We have talked about me moving in next March when my lease is up. 
Today I was talking to him on the phone and I mentioned how I am going to pay down my debt before we move in. He said if we work out. I asked what he meant, he said that‚Äôs a while away and anything could happen, we could die in a train crash tomorrow. I asked if he thinks we won‚Äôt work out, he said he didn‚Äôt mean that and he doesn‚Äôt think anything could happen.
Idk just makes me feel like he isn‚Äôt sure or I am looking into it too much"
So I‚Äôm 16 and I‚Äôve been talking to this girl online for a while (15) and all the sudden she texts me saying that we can‚Äôt talk anymore because we are getting ‚Äútoo close‚Äù and I tried to ask her what she means and she started crying and blocked me on snap. Currently she still has me added on Xbox and has said she will continue to play Xbox but we can‚Äôt talk anymore. I really don‚Äôt know how to handle this so if you guys could help that would be great.
"I am a 20 year old male, and I think I have an attractive face, but I have bad social anxiety in most situations, leading me to never have the courage to ask a girl out. I am getting into calisthenics and cleaning up my diet, but I am worried that I will join ‚Äúthe game‚Äù too late. I am also stuck at home due to quarantine to protect my family from the virus, and all of my classes are online, preventing me from being able to go out and actually meet someone. I also am genuinely unsure as to how I am meant to approach a woman. I legitimately do not understand how it is so easy for some people to go into relationships one after the other. Any advice would be appreciated."
"My BF doesn‚Äôt like to go downtown on me because he said he doesn‚Äôt like my kitty.
But I shower daily, and get checked regularly. I know that everything downtown is nice so it‚Äôs confusing to me why he acts like I‚Äôm a piece of trash that he doesn‚Äôt want to touch. I‚Äôve never had these problems before."
So I (M17) cheated on my girlfriend (F19) by texting other girls throughout the relationship and she found out and broke up with me when I was living with her. We were together for four months but we were best friends before we started dating. When we broke up we promised we would still be best friends but now she hates me and barely texts me and leaves me on read. It's almost been a month since we broke up and she told me recently that what I did was really shitty and that I didn't really give her space when she asked for it and I take the blame for that but I want her back in my life and she told me she doesn't really want anything to do with me so I'm trying my best to get her back and I'm open for any help or advice on what to do.
"I feel like some people use this phrase and don't realize that you cant just simply tell people to ""take everything I say at face value"" when their actions don't always seem to align.. 

So how have you found out that you can or can not truly take someone at face value? 

specific examples are always awesome if you have time to share them!"
I (19m) have been snapping this girl (19F) for a while. Matched with her on tinder. We have hung out at least 5 times alone. Nothing has happened sexually. Last time we hung out was like 1.5 weeks ago. Spring break happened and we weren‚Äôt around each other. The last 2 days she‚Äôs left me on read twice. Is she trying to tell me she doesn‚Äôt want to talk anymore?
"I was wondering could snapping/texring to frequently ruin my relationship with my gf? We have been snapping for the past 3 months and basically responding every 10-20 minutes. Could this harm our relationship?? 

Some extra info about situation is that we go to same school but barely see each other due to heavy workloads. We see each other on the weekends and stuff. 

whatever just curious on other people's opinions. and maybe an idea of how frequently others snap loved ones"
"Me (28M single) 

In my family we get teached

1 study learn for your future and keep learning 

2 find a good job work 

3 have a house and a wife and family oneday 

Is this the right way of Doing things in this order"
"So I(M19) have a small problem. My girlfriend (F18) is very attached to me, emotionally and physically. And lately I've been getting annoyed with her cause of the constant texting and snaps she sends me. Idk how to tell her I'm drowning from the affection and attention. I need some space and I dont want to be rude to her."
"A month ago a girl(22) has proposed to me(21) again, but I don't know why this time I accepted her proposal and she is very happy with all these but now I am realizing that I don't want to do this coz I love my own company, I'm not a gay I just love to spend time in learning new things and now I give all my time to her.

So I don't know what to do now, and here I am writing all these while ignoring her texts.

I think I am selfish :("
"I (F21)have been dating my boyfriend (M28) for 6months now, and i never felt comfortable like this with anyone to share my thoughts/ feelings/ worries, my true self, and we talk about almost everything with no worries of being judged, but there are specific things that I can‚Äôt talk to him about, and he has those things too, as an example he avoids telling me issues that make him upset about his family, or moving in together that we already had a brief conversation about a while ago, 
It‚Äôs like I‚Äôm very comfortable and super uncomfortable with him at the same time, and I don‚Äôt know how can i make that go away"
"So my 3 boyfriends wont stop throwing out my yogurt when its ""expired"". Yesterday, they decided to throw out my raisin flavored yogurt. When I Boyfriend#2 why he had done it he said that it was one day past expiration date. They did the same thing again with my dragon fruit yogurt but this time it was even expired and boyfriend #2 had done it again! (it was a week after expiration). I've tried talking to my other 2 boyfriends but they think boyfriend #2 is doing the right thing.

&amp;#x200B;

What should I do so I can eat my yogurt in peace. At this point I'm honestly considering getting a minifridge to put in my garden so I can hide it from him."
"Ok sooooo. 
Me and my bf have been on and off for about 3 years. One of his close friends had a girlfriend and she kept calling my bf ‚Äúdaddy‚Äù. So I did act out of drunk anger and tried to fight her (this was about a year ago). Now this friend of his wants my bf to go gambling this weekend but his friend doesn‚Äôt want me to come with. 
I feel super awkward because my bf wants me to go, but doesn‚Äôt want to tell me that his friend doesn‚Äôt want me there. 
I am laughing nervously with loads of anxiety and don‚Äôt know what to do. üôÉ I probably shouldn‚Äôt even be paying this much attention to this situation. But I‚Äôm human and like to overthink things and hurt my own feelings. ü•≤"
"I‚Äôve been always oblivious to men flirting with me, until one of my friends pointed out to me that I‚Äôm dumb and have no clue that men are flirting when I totally thought they‚Äôre not. I met my neighbor‚Äôs friend today, and we had a small talk and then he asked me what I do for living(I‚Äôm a Spanish teacher) and as far as I knew from my neighbor that he speaks Spanish but not a native speaker, so I told him he should travel to Spanish speaking country for a lil while to learn the language and my neighbor laughed at me for saying this. Was he flirting and trying to hit on me and I totally thought he was serious about the Spanish learning. I honestly have no clue."
"I'm really perplexed and disappointed by my ex. 

We broke up in December 2020 and it was a relatively amicable split (neither of us could do distance anymore). In late January, my mother died of a stroke and I am so devastated by this. Historically, my ex had always been there for me when things were challenging. We have a few mutual friends and one who let him know of my mother's passing, and he never reached out. Not even any simple condolences similar to what I received from acquaintances. I don't want to rekindle our romance, but I thought it was common courtesy to reach out when someone dies? I'm just looking for perspectives on this...Thank you!"
"So today is an anniversary of a family death. Long story short my boyfriend of 13 years found his uncle dead and then we moved into his house. He hasn't been the same since. He's always had some emotional issues (super reserved) to the point I almost think hes a psychopath. But something happened to him two years ago and hes never been the same. Our relationship has become incredibly strained amd we are not in a good place, regardless today marks two years and I was wodering if any one has any suggestions for me, what I can do if anything to make the day less miserable. Do I ignore it do something? Any help would be greatly appreciated since I'm sitting here trembling for when he gets home from work life hasn't been the same since we moved here so I'm extra nervous for how he is today."

"Even if you confess and are remorseful, having every intention of doing right.

My ex would reach out to me occasionally when her world came crashing down and I always responded and ended our conversations with I love you my best friend.

If your partner expresses she wish she could leave you, but doesn't have the strength to. 

Then tells you if you at least respected her you would break up with her rather than drag this out. 
Because despite all the joy the relationship has brought, this incidents destroyed all the innocence of a monogamous relationship.

Part of me says fight till you drop. 
The other part says I've done enough damage"
"My girlfriend made friends with this guy I find really annoying a few months back. He‚Äôs trying to act nice but it‚Äôs textbook that he‚Äôs going after her. A few weeks back, he tried to kiss her and my girlfriend obviously hated that and didn‚Äôt talk to him since. However, just today, my girlfriend told me how they were talking again and she will still be friendly and make friends with him. I really hate this and sometimes I wish she‚Äôd just cut off that guy, but she likes ‚Äúbeing nice‚Äù and ‚Äúkeeping her connections‚Äù. 

For context, me and my girlfriend are an underground couple for personal reasons. We have been dating for a year now."
"You kinda looked like my ex. What does that mean ?

Wht does it mean when she has a bf ?

It was a compliment ‚Äî positive one *

So my (F 20) sister cheated on her boyfriend (M 21). She went over to a dude‚Äôs house she‚Äôs known for 4 years. They ended up getting high and hooking up. She called me crying saying she cheated and that she‚Äôs guilt ridden. She doesn‚Äôt know where to be up front and tell her bf or not. However I‚Äôm starting to worry. She hasn‚Äôt slept in nearly 2 days and can barely eat. I don‚Äôt want her to starve herself and be sleep deprived. I can tell she‚Äôs hurting a lot from what happened. How do I help?
"As the title states, I haven‚Äôt seen my boyfriend in 2 months. His brother has a lot of medical issues one being basically no immune system at all. We‚Äôve been together for 11 months now and have never had any real problems except for this one. I don‚Äôt want to sound selfish but it causes a major strain on our relationship. I don‚Äôt know how to make this work through just text message. I want to be with him but I find myself missing him more and more everyday and it‚Äôs becoming harder and harder to deal with. I‚Äôm at a complete loss and I just wanna feel normal in this relationship. Thank you in advance:)"
"I have been dating my boyfriend for almost four years, and i feel like we‚Äôre in limbo. We can‚Äôt go to the next step because of money, and i feel like i am not where i want to be in life. I am finishing up schooling soon, and will try to land a job in my field but he hasn‚Äôt been able to for a while. I want much more than what i have right now, what should i do"
"I‚Äôm (26F) in a relationship with a guy (26M) who has been my friend for years. He is bound to get married anytime soon (on the lookout for a partner) however both of us just can‚Äôt seem to get over each other. (We cannot marry each other also due to other differences) 

Although he has clarified me that he is trying to move on from me and so should I, but we are still in pretty much the same zone as any other couple- meet often, talk almost all day, physically involved etc. 

I‚Äôm confused now if I should continue with this kind of relationship by just hanging in there, as it gives me more time to spend with him. However, at the same time I‚Äôm also scared that this leaves me at his mercy, he might find a good marriageable woman soon and abandon me for her. Please help."
"I recently had to tell this girl that I wasn‚Äôt interested in her, and I feel like I did it correctly. I made sure to be nice and I just told her honestly that I wasn‚Äôt interested in anything romantic with her but that I think she‚Äôs a pretty cool person. Even though I tried my best to be nice and not embarrass her or anything, she ended up crying and now all of her friends are super angry at me. I don‚Äôt really know what I did wrong but everyone seems to think I‚Äôm an asshole now."
"I (31F) met a guy (29M) on Tinder on 26/01, went over to his, had the best sex of my life. On 31/01 he moved in with me as he lost his job due to COVID and is still unemployed and I am carrying him financially. I haven‚Äôt had anyone for over 8 years and this whole thing has moved so quickly and I am feeling so overwhelmed. I really like him, I do but I feel he is getting comfortable now. We don‚Äôt have sex anymore, he sleeps in to atleast 11:00 everyday and plays video games until early morning hours while I try to sleep to be able to deal with my corporate job that requires concentration and I have started to make mistakes due to lack of sleep. I thought only teenage boys ate this much, but I was wrong. He is really sweet and caring, but I am so frustrated with this whole situation"
"So I am currently in college and have not made any friends other than my roommate. I want to try branching out and talking to classmates but a lot of them are actually women. I have a girlfriend in a long distance relationship so I'm not interested in dating anyone else, nor do I want them to think I am interested. I want them to just see me as a friend but I have found it hard to do that in the past. What I mean is it seems like I come across as flirting with them when I actually am just trying to hang out because I have no friends. What I have done in the past is talk to them and ask if they want to hang out or get food, but it really seems indistinguishable from asking someone on a date. What can I do to prevent this?"
"The age gap is weird. She's overly clingy. One of us is always apologizing for something. There's always something to worry about. She relies on me too much and never anyone else so I have to solve everything. I crave the feeling of being loved in that way but It's not worth it anymore. Breaking up with her will devastate her and it'll hurt me too but I think I should just rip the bandaid off. I talked to my best friend (16M) about it and he says I should just get it over with too. I plan on breaking up with her tomorrow and I'm not afraid of it, I'm still dreading it though. I think some opinions from people who are wiser and better than me at this stuff would help out so yeah, can I get some advice on if I should do it or not?"
How can one handle long distance relationship
I'm so horny girl free nudes add my kik...sdanjila
"My girlfriend and I are running out of things to do in our free time. There's some underlying focus issues preventing us from simply talking sadly... :/ So it's better to keep ourselves busy by doing things together -- usually playing the same games or watching videos she likes.

Does anyone have any ideas on how to shake things up? I feel we've played every online-co op game in existence, and watching videos/series all day is getting a little old. Maybe there's a way to do a project together or... idk. Please help, thank you for reading"
I‚Äôve never had a single gf in my life so is it bad to want high standards like this ?
"In 2019 I met my (m16) girlfriend (f17) at the time and in the spring of 2019 I had the best time of my life, but that summer things were pretty rough, she was graduating and was going on a gap year trip and was kinda messing around with our co worker( we worked at the same restaurant during that summer) and ever since then I‚Äôve just been feeling super sad and have missed it ever since. I‚Äôve got into another relationship (may 2020) but have recently broke it off. And since breaking it off I‚Äôve just been thinking about it since, it‚Äôs like with my most recent relationship I was just frustrated with that one which distracted me for the most part, I just need some advice on how to deal with it"
"My wife has been upset because we‚Äôre not on the exact same page about wanting kids.
For my wife, having kids is non-negotiable, and is something she wants. She would end the relationship if ever decided on not having kids. 
My view is that it‚Äôs something that I really want, but isn‚Äôt non-negotiable. I wouldn‚Äôt end our marriage or file for divorce if she decided that she didn't want them.
This difference is troubling her and I think I understand the following:
1. It's important to her to have kids with someone who wants it just as much as her.
2. She feels like the decision on having kids is solely up to her.

Any advice on how I can communicate and assure her it's something I truly want, and not just because she does?"
"I know, just to start off being friends with benefits with your ex is not a good move, but we are having fun. But recently I have noticed myself get jealous when I hear about the stuff she did after we broke up or stuff she‚Äôs telling me about present day. Do I bring this up to her? Do I go with the flow?"
"Out of impulsive, there is an immediate reaction, and I need some advice on how one can explain the people sensitivity so that it comes by natural. Any suggestion I can explain his in a better way without getting into any argument."
"So, I've had my fair of bad relationships over the years but I thought I finally got lucky. My girlfriend and I have been together for almost four years, a few days ago I had a friend inform me that she might be cheating on me. Bro has always had my back and I love him &amp; trust him like fam. Anyway he looked into it and found out that she has been sending explicit messages and photos to other men. He provided evidence &amp; wouldn't tell me how long its been going on for but said I should leave. I dont know what to do? I felt so much love for my girlfriend over the past years but im so broken &amp; conflicted right now. I seriously thought I would marry this woman, but now what the fuck? Seriously."
Hi all I am a 39 (f) and I am seeing someone younger than me I had a few crappy realationships in the past . But my issue is we don't live together he lives a hr away from me we see each other as much as we can but we are not labled as a couple but the way he acts gives off signs he wants a relationship but is to indecisive about it I am really growing feelings and don't know how to tell him I love him with out scaring him off
"A few days ago my bestfriend and I hooked up, but before we both said we were gonna go back to being just friends right after. He's pretending nothing happened but I feel really weird about it, I think I have feelings for him now. I didn't like him before, but somethings changed. We've been friends for seven years, I dunno how he'll react. How do I proceed from here? Do I tell him how I feel?"
"im really excited because i love her a lot and want to spend my life with her but i think we may have taken things too fast and ive lost interest in her already, i hate it a lot and i reaaally need some advice, thank you if you can help!"
"I‚Äôve come to find out I‚Äôm not all that interested in the person I‚Äôm currently seeing they‚Äôre a great friend but I‚Äôm not finding myself enjoying the relationship, I dread when they call me but they‚Äôre going through a really difficult time right now and I‚Äôm concerned me leaving them would push them over the edge. Should I just hold out till the difficult situation is over or should I just end it now? They are great to me but I just don‚Äôt find myself all that into them unfortunately they‚Äôre fantastic in every way. I‚Äôve just come to lose attraction and I‚Äôve been thinking of an ex very recently non stop even though there is no hope of them being in contact with me again. I‚Äôm scared I‚Äôll lose a friend‚Ä¶"

"I‚Äôve been talking to someone, it‚Äôs my first time. What are things I should know and look out for?"
in the beginning of the relationship i was scared from past experiences so i kinda pushed him away and then i eventually began to open up and now iam fully in love. he however gave up and seems to have moved on. i want to know what can i do to fix things and work towards getting back together. we are best friends now and we do everything together but im trying so hard i truly love him more than anything. i really need advice on what to do here. thank you so much
"Im having a difficult time accepting my breakup. My partner doesn‚Äôt want to be with me anymore and after days of talking he isn‚Äôt change his stance. I know the hard truth and reality is that i cant change his mind or will be able to. My brain is having such a tough time processing this as a fact. Im in denial and im really making a fool out of myself. I keep texting him and trying to get a glimmer of hope. I know the truth. I know i need to let go. Why can‚Äôt i accept that.

Having a really difficult time coping with my emotions at the moment. Im devastated. Please provide advice on what i can do to be ok. Should i meditate on the calm app? Just cant really cope with this."
"It doesn‚Äôt matter if it was for 2 months or 2 years, when it is over, I lose my will to go on. What is this?"
"I've been seeing this girl and we have tried to have sex multiple times but it has not worked out. I just didn't get hard or if I did get hard I would go soft striaght away. I do find her attractive and I think she looks cute so I don't understand why this is happening. 
Even trying to masturbate I have to think about others first to get hard in the first place. I'm really confused and idk what's going on. 
Last time I saw her I used Viagra and managed to have sex with her but I don't know if that counts :/

I can't get hard over this girl I am seeing. I like her alot but I am starting to think I'm not sexually attracted to her."
"So I found a girlfriend some time ago, we have a lot of fun when together and we don't hang out at each others houses but go outside and hang out there.
We have talked about sex and we're both ready for it.
My question is, how do I proceed to make a move or get get her to have sex with me without coming of as weird and saying like ""suck my dick"" or something an asshole would say.
I should mention it's our boths first time and we're both 16 years old
Help a brother out."
"Hello, met a guy on a dating app/site. When we matched, we would message each other everyday, and for the past month, we got off the app, and I added him on my facebook, we still talk everyday. I send him one text a day around 5pm. Is it bad to text someone you're interested in everyday? ü§î I won't get to met him, until 2-3months from now. Is that too much texting?"
"I told my girlfriend of a year that I'm not sure if I love her. This is my first relationship and I grew up in a single parent household(my dad and mom were accessible). I care about her a lot, but I don't know what love is supposed to feel like. Sometimes I want to be with her, sometimes I don't really care too much. I might be a little bipolar, because this is how my life is. Sometimes I want to do something then the next I could care less. My childhood hasn't been the best so I'm not sure what is love."
"Hello all!,

So ive met this girl a week ago and things are going so well, we've hitted it off in an insane way and were both in love with each other. 
But its only been one week and we're both sorta nervous. 
Is going that fast dangerous? 
Is there a speed limit to love? 
Thanks"
"So I (19f) started seeing this guy(24m) casually. We both just got out of a relationship so I don‚Äôt want to date anyone. Our initial convo I told him I want it to be exclusive (which I understand not everyone will be okay with but he agreed with me).

I made the mistake of checking his Tinder and he updated it. I‚Äôm not surprised bc we are fwb after all but I feel hurt that I‚Äôm not enough for him. I honestly don‚Äôt care to date him but I‚Äôm attached to him and the attention he gives me. It sucks and I don‚Äôt understand my emotions. We have a hotel room booked tomorrow night and I don‚Äôt even know if I want to go. How can I break this off without it getting too messy?"
"My 18 year old hookup(f) is scared she might be pregnant. We had sex a week ago 2 days after her period ended, I gave her the plan b in 24 hours (but later on I found out plan b is less effective on women over 175 pounds) &amp; she‚Äôs been texting me saying she‚Äôs been feeling nauseous &amp; been spotting. It‚Äôs only been a week since we had sex and she took the plan b. Is it the side effects of the plan b or is she pregnant?"
"College aged, don‚Äôt know where to go for first date especially during this pandemic. Any advice?"
Im 18m my ex gf 19f dumped me in November for another guy and came up with a excuse saying she still loves me and wants to be friends which i declined she says she  has to date him coz she in an arranged marriage i don't believe her coz she seems happier and posts him on her ig which she never did with me  and even blocked me from seeing her ig stories  and spends more time with him when i only saw her like twice or thrice a month and never had time to go out on a date with me. I recently got into college and she texted me after me going no contact for about 3 months saying congrats and that shes happy for me but i left her on deliverd and never responded.Im still healing from the break up and dont know wat to make of all this thoughts ?part of me is still waiting for her to come back
"I (16F) have a solid guy friend(15F) who I've known for quite a while, he lives near me but I only started being friends with him last march. Anyway, we were on a discord call with some other friends, and he turned his webcam around to show his closet or something and I noticed my profile was pinned (I had video on). Sometimes I feel like our relationship is tense where it shouldn't be, or that he tries to impress me. We also make a lot of sexual jokes, but I think they're just jokes? Especially since I am in a relationship. 

Am I just overthinking? Is there any other reason he would have me pinned? He doesn't have any other girl friends other than my best friend, who is a lesbian. What do you guys think?"
"So a boy I liked texted me this and I‚Äôm Confused on what it means.

You kno that you could‚Äôve been calling me that out side of public üôÅ

~what do he mean outside of public? Keep in mind we work at Walmart also~"
"So I (23M) talked to a girl for about 6 months but before that we‚Äôd been talking off and on for about 3.5 years. I‚Äôve always enjoyed her personality and never doubted that she wanted the best for me. 

However due to life circumstances we haven‚Äôt really been near each other, like 1700 miles apart. We parted mutually and I miss her but she‚Äôs given me many chances throughout the years and I‚Äôve always done her wrong. I regret that but can‚Äôt change it. 

I‚Äôve been promiscuous during my teens and 20‚Äôs and I‚Äôm getting tired of it and want something serious. She knows my past and accepted me. 

My conflict is I don‚Äôt think I should reach out to her but I miss her. I often think about reaching out but decide against because it could upset her and make things worse."
"So in the past we had issues with my boyfriend being on what‚Äôs app and talking to this girl and also his ex. 
So he promised to delete it and not go on it to prevent any issues 

We had an argument during the day about our sex life how it just hasn‚Äôt been great lately because we‚Äôre both so jammed working 

I go on what‚Äôs up this morning to message my sister and I realize he was last online today at 1:20am!! 

He was doing well staying away but now that‚Äôs he was on it‚Äôs like he didn‚Äôt respect our agreement 

No I‚Äôm not going through his phone or anything but what bothers me it‚Äôs he didn‚Äôt keep his word! 

Any advice on how to talk to him"
"
My friends are telling me to run to which I don‚Äôt understand. I am in my early 20s and my person is in their early 30s. We used to take turn paying but now it‚Äôs about a 30/70 ratio, with me paying 30. We‚Äôve never gone out anywhere fancy except for my birthday, to which that fancy meal WAS my birthday gift so I don‚Äôt count it... but my friends disapprove for many reasons like such. We‚Äôve had rocky turns because I brought up his actions that come off as being cheap towards me but still managed to be together foe nearly a year. Would being considered ‚Äúcheap‚Äù to one‚Äôs significant other beconsidered a runaway sign?"
"She use to shave, but for some reason, she stopped. Honestly, it's a turnoff. she is really hairy and it's uncomfortable to go down on her. Sometimes pubic hair gets in my mouth. A combination of her natural wetness and my own saliva gets soaked into her hair and I have to plunge my face in that making my beard soaked in the process. How do I convince her to shave without sounding like an asshole?"
"I feel like I love my ex boyfriend (we have broken up 3 times and we keep coming back together...) but there's also this friend that I'm sexually attracted to and we have such a great time with each other... 
Just to be clear, I talk with both guys and they both like me. So, now I'm confused."
"My girlfriend loves when I fuck her ass. I always thought that was more of a porn thing or that women basically only did that for to please men. 

She says she likes it because its really tight and naughty. She likes it only in one position though, doggy, while rubbing her clit. 

Are there any girls out there that love anal? Or is she weird?"
"My bf (36) often turns into a giant baby. I‚Äôve always dated very manly men and this time I went with a really nice guy. Well he‚Äôs super nice, except his gets in moods and always acts like a p***y. He can‚Äôt walk the dog without being pulled, he gets a cut and practically cries about it and ANYtime he feels slightly insulted, he becomes MEGA defensive in like a salty way. What do I do?"
"As the title says, I just discovered that my best friend was raped by her boyfriend, twice. He forced himself on her. But for whatever reason, she still won‚Äôt leave him. She still forgives him. When she texted him saying they need to have a serious talk soon, his reply was along the lines of that everything is all his fault, he tried his best (presumably to not hurt her whatsoever), basically playing the victim. 

I really want to bash his face in dammit.

Edit: I want to help her, but I don‚Äôt know how."
"I have a long time friend(~8 years), we're in different countries now. Today he told me his small daughter passed away due to corona. He's inconsolable and I have no idea how to help him except apologize and offer any help I can. It hurts to see him in so much grief. I don't know what to do to help him through it. He put his entire soul into raising his daughter through a lot of tough times. She was beautiful and was uncommonly understanding and kind and he truly believed an angel came to him as his daughter and saved him during the dark times in his life."
I just found out that my crush likes me back and that if I asked her out then she will say yes. I‚Äôm almost 15 and am wondering how I should ask them out on a date and where would we go?
I (F21) have been on and off again with an old co-worker (M21). We dated briefly but it has just been hookups. I can‚Äôt if he‚Äôs cutting the cake and eating it too or if this is just all he can give me right now. What should I do? When is enough enough ?
"I would first say, I‚Äôm in my late 20‚Äôs now &amp; I‚Äôm 5Ft 7inch. Reason I mentioned that is because I would say in my teenage years up until 22 I was the guy that attracted a lot girls in my age group. I had decent social skills, I am a very good dancer, good looking 8/10 &amp; also a good sense of style. I have always been the type of guy that wanted a serious relationship. so as I turned 23 I had series of almost relationships &amp; couple of No‚Äôs from girls. I was in 2 serious relationships between 24-26 years but it ended the same way, started out great then sadly faded away. In my late 20‚Äôs now it has become even worse I have not dated anyone in 2 + years &amp; now that I moved to Europe 4 months ago I have had 0 luck with anyone so far. I don‚Äôt know what exactly what I‚Äôm doing wrong?"
This girl in my class likes me in gym how do I start a conversation with her
"so just a backstory, i met by now bf when i was 16 online, he was 20 at the time
 
i was not clear about my age from the start and he thinks i turned 18 last year, im actually 17 and i turn 18 this year

it has been almost a year and i havent told him, i feel like i cant because he might hate me
i feel so bad for lying to him, and he still doesn't know, i have no idea how to tell him
i know he doesnt deserve this but i love him so much and i wasnt even planning on getting into a relationship but here we are

any advice?"
"So guys , i recently followed a girl from my city and she followed me back .
The question is
How can i shoot my shot?
She recently posted a story saying:
‚ÄúI shoot my shot by posting a story so you can shooy yout shot...stupid‚Äù
I need your advice"
"
just curious for the girlfriends/boyfriends out there: 

where do your boundaries stand for your s/o hanging out with another girl/guy alone? (whether hanging out, eating together, going to each other‚Äôs house, drinking together alone)

this is assuming they are platonic friends"
"My mom and I got into an argument because she thinks I'm having premarital sex (I am) and she thinks it's a ""sin"". I told her I wasn't and she took my phone and asked me for the password to it. I told her I wasn't giving my password to her and she said I have a few hours to give her the password or ""I'll be in trouble"". I have things on that phone I'd rather her not see, Inappropriate and Illegal things. Like dirty texts, nudes, and me texting my drug dealer. ***How can I get her to let this go??***"
"Today my boyfriend (20M) made a joke that hurt me(18F). I started crying and I told him that he always makes fun of me, for everything.
In response to that, he apologized and he started crying and calling himself names and saying he‚Äôs the worst boyfriend.
I noticed a pattern in this, every time I tell him that something he did hurt me, he does this.
I feel like the conversation shift from me being hurt, to him, and I have to reassure him he‚Äôs not a bad boyfriend.

I‚Äôm not good at explaining but this is what happened"
Please share your thoughts on this matter. I understand. But not fully.
"just curious for the girlfriends out there: 

where do your boundaries stand for your s/o hanging out with another girl alone? (whether hanging out, eating together, going to each other‚Äôs house, drinking together alone)"
"So when I (F, 20) as dating my ex boyfriend (M,21)  sometimes there would be some pain (probably just cause I wasn't turned on enough). I would let him know. He didn't necessarily stop but he did switch positions angles or speeds and slow down. Sometimes it would be fine after and it would feel better and we could finish. Other times we might try a little bit a that slower speed/different angle and it would still hurt and I would tell him to stop and he would. Is that okay that we didn't stop entirely right away? We never had a thing where it was like you have to stop entirely if it hurts."
"He said sorry if I‚Äôm killing the convo I‚Äôm not in the mood to talk and hasn‚Äôt talked to me for three days. I know he needed space so I left him. But recently I found out he‚Äôs talking to everyone fine but me! I‚Äôm not sure what I did wrong.. but I can tell he replies to my msges late or when he has time, even when he sees the msges earlier...  is he not interested in me ?"
"So, after the boy said yes, they started dating. But after 2 weeks they are already like planning stuff and saying ""I will always love you, I will never have feelings for anyone else, and it will always be this way"".  Also ""this could be for life"". I really want their relationship to work out, but I can't help thinking if a high school (in Adelaide, Australia yr 8 is high school) relationship can last that long?"
"So basically when I listen to any song I enjoy, I automatically day dream like normal people. Occasionally I daydream about my ex and the feeling I get when I think of my ex feels so great when compared to the other girls/crushes I have currently. Is this normal and is this possibly because of attachment I had with my ex?"
"Okay I didn't know how to really explain this in the title but basically they'll give people ""position"" labels. We often will be talking about some celebrities or something of the sort and once we get into the topic of their friendship or relationship in general they'll start calling someone a top, bottom, or switch. And it's not like I asked them what they think, they just will blurt it out constantly along with giving people, more specifically smaller men a more feminine role and reasoning with why a person got their position. This might also be a factor but for a while they've been reading ""yaoi"" basically manga with gay sex in it... But is this something I should be concerned about or will they eventually get out of this phase? (as a little side note were in our late teens?)"
"I‚Äôm a grad student and I work 8-10 hours a day, sometimes even more. My fianc√© is not working and not studying at this point until July 2020. Most of the days he goes skiing, mtb, plays video games etc. When I‚Äôm very busy he always occupies his time to have fun with his friends or alone. He never takes 1 hour to stay home around me and do something nice that can reduce my workload by feeling loved/ cared for. 

I feel like jt should be undisputed that when one person has a lot of time and another person is busy, the first one should make time to do little things for their loved one like cooking, cleaning etc. are my expectations too high?"
Could really use some advice right now
"I (14m) really likes a (17f) and she likes me back, she turns 18 soon and i turn 15 soon, idk if this is like okay or not, i‚Äôm pretty mature for my age and that‚Äôs why she‚Äôs interested in me in the first place, i would just like peoples opinion on this and their thoughts, thank you."
"I‚Äôm on my mid 20s and I have come to a realization that the older I get and begin transitioning to a different part of my life, the less ‚Äúreal, true‚Äù friends I am having. I feel like at every stage of life, I will have less and less friends because it just becomes harder to relate on things and spend time together. Responsibilities are also greater. I‚Äôm a social person and I love meeting new people but just this realization has been daunting. How do you guys make friends at a later stage in life? Good friends who you can laugh with and be yourself without having to worry about anything? Thank you !"
"my (18m) dumbass broke up with my girlfriend (17f) because she snuck out of her house, and didn‚Äôt tell me, then lied about it. it turned out that she was sneaking out for a family issue. her uncle called me and told me everything and threatened to kill me and come to my house and put me ‚Äú30 feet under.‚Äù i love this girl and ended it over anger and i feel so bad and she won‚Äôt answer my texts or calls. she knows i have trust issues and that my last ex snuck out and cheated, but she did this tn and it set me off. i ended it respectfully and nice, but i still didn‚Äôt mean anything. i truly love this girl and i need her back."
So this is going to seem like a scrambled mess but here we go anyway. I found out like a week ago that my ex girlfriend is pregnant we ended things on really bad terms almost a year ago but have been talking and trying to work things out for around 3 months. When I found out I felt such a flood of mixed emotions because I really do love this girl more than anything so we spent a few days discussing if we were ready for a kid or not. Things were going good until I found out she was cheating on me when we first started talking and now I feel like everything we finally started to rebuild is gone and I don‚Äôt know if I want to bring a child into a world with an unhappy couple. Is there a way to rebuild trust so we can give this a real shot?
I feel a bit upset since my boyfriend hasn‚Äôt asked me to be his Valentine‚Äôs yet. I asked him when he was going to ask me. He responded saying he doesn‚Äôt feel the need to ask me since we have been dating. Should I feel upset??? Or???
"So valentine's day is Tomorrow and my girlfriend has asked me to decide on what we are gonna watch. Since I am a huge fan of anime and need something funny and romantic, any suggestions? (Max 2 hrs long)

(P.S we are both 17 so , please help me out!)"
"Ok so i am exhausted now and wanted ask u people what to do . My dad is normal body builder except one thing he believes that ""mobile phones causes cancer , because of radiation "" . Now I don't have problem but he yells at me every day ""you will suffer from radiation and die "" now this has been there since I was 12 year old (I am 15), so I started learning and radiation and do  mostly to see if he is right or not and I found that mobile radiation my causehead ache but it's not ionizing like radiation emitted from uranium etc , when told about this he started getting angry and yelling at me that I will die ,plus he is the only source of income in our family . What should In this situation Reddit ?"
So I recently broke these off with my girlfriend because we were together for three years and my feelings faded. We tried so hard to make it work but I just felt like i needed to go my own way and do my own thing. But seeing her go out with people I don‚Äôt know and feeling just sadness and anger it‚Äôs so confusing to me and i know I have no right to be upset but I just don‚Äôt know why i feel this way
"Why do I push people away? Everytime something goes well I just can‚Äôt help but think that sooner or later things will just worsen or whatever relationship it may be it‚Äôll end. I push people away, I get mean and act like I don‚Äôt care when I actually do. I‚Äôm afraid of loosing people so I rather cut them off, although they great. What can I do? :( I‚Äôve destroyed friendships I‚Äôve had because of that. I don‚Äôt know, maybe I‚Äôm damaged."
"So to contextualize this, I forgot during a heated night to pull out when I came. 

Before this my gf and I consistently had unprotected sex and she was okay with me doing so we have been together for over 2 years now where this has been okay, she mentioned she wanted me not do that a few months ago and I agreed. 

We hadn't had sex since(pandemic) and it slipped my mind completely when we had sex. Is this assault? how do we move forward? I am planning on bringing this up to my counselor so any advice on that would also be appreciated."
"My (28, M) girlfriend (23, F) confessed to me that she had a subjectively heavy make-out session with one of our very close friends. I was not present. She went to his apartment after work bc roads were bad (and thank Heavens she did, bc they were awful).

How should I feel about this? I love both of them soo much. I respect them both sooo much. Idk what I should do, or how I should feel. Is it cheating? I'm kinda just lost on how I feel and how I /should/ feel."
"Theres a female friend that i want to date but i am unsure on how to approach her. Very late last year, she gave me her number, then a week later blocked me. Now, since the beginning of this month she has been showing interest in me, by flirting, complimenting me, pointing me out in group convos, basically making it known that she likes me.

The thing that‚Äôs keeping me from asking her out is, why would she block me then act like she wants me, is whats confusing me. She does have a kid thats 18 months now, and ofc the baby daddy is still around obviously because of the kid which is cool. 

I need help figuring out on how to approach her and if the signs she‚Äôs giving are a green light or not or is she playing the typical female game on wanting the man to make the move."
She‚Äôs cute and gives me butterflies. I just don‚Äôt want to be unprofessional if she‚Äôs not into me but I feel like she could be. But life is short too right?!! What do you think?
"I just don't feel it anymore, and I do care for him- as a friend. He's had some bad relationships before, and ours was healthy and perfectly fine. That's why I'm so hesitant to do it, I dont wanna hurt him. 

Do I slowly distance myself? idk what to do"
"I'm (24F) currently talking to this guy (30M) and he's been nice so far. He has made it clear that he wants to settle down coz he's already 30. 

It's not that I think it's a bad thing but I just hate how some men magically grow some balls when their time is _running out_."
"As the title says this girl I like and who likes me is moving and we‚Äôve gotten kinda close, but I don‚Äôt know what I should do, I want to pursue a relationship but I might just end up getting hurt when she leaves. I don‚Äôt know what to do"
"It‚Äôs been ten years since my ex and I broke up and I  have thought of him every single day since. I loved him so much and I still mourn that great love that we shared. So much time has passed yet I haven‚Äôt felt the same love and passion for anybody else. 
I‚Äôm really not sure what to do, how do you get over a love like this?"
It‚Äôs pretty simple my roommates ex tried to hookup with me and the background is [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/l03gsx/my_roommates_exhookup18f_tried_to_hookup_with/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=ios_app&amp;utm_name=iossmf). Please take a look it‚Äôs not very good. I‚Äôve remained chill with her because I don‚Äôt want to tell him. I‚Äôve told her when we‚Äôre sober that I don‚Äôt want to have sex and asked her to stop trying to. Tonight she just texted me straight up ‚Äúcome over‚Äù. Trust me it means she‚Äôs trying to have sex. What do I do? Do I tell him this is happening I really don‚Äôt want to!!
"okay so, hey. i (nb14) am currently stuck in what feels like being my friend groups emotional support pretty much. hell, my friend (f13) called me the therapist friend on a quotev quiz we took together and i just can‚Äôt stop thinking about it. 

ive realized that im always there for everyone, and i hardly get anything in return - only being talked to if someone needs something. i feel so used and i don‚Äôt know what to do and im just so stressed out

like, i love these guys but i feel more like a therapist than an equal. 

i texted my friend i mentioned earlier asking to talk because im feeling negative emotions and it‚Äôs been an hour and she hasn‚Äôt responded. are my friends using me?"
" About a month ago i started seeing this guy, we hooked uo, he flaked two days in a row and was disrespecting my time (confirmed plans literally 30 min before, then flaked) so i told him i wasnt wanting to chill anymore, he apologized and he came over a couple weeks later we talked about it, i said i wasnt mad i was just not interested in someone who disrespected my time, and sinply less interested. and if he didnt want to plenty of other guys would. i saw a tiktok (stupid i know) some girl used the phrase ""im not mad just less interested"" and a few people said this was so harsh and toxic, but i never meant it that way i was being fully honest. did i say anything wrong?"
"Hi everyone. I am a 20(F) and my boyfriend is 24. We have been friends for about 3 years, but started dating around 9 months ago. When we first started dating we had lots of sex and couldn‚Äôt keep our hands off of each other, but now he hardly ever touches me, kisses me, or wants to have sex. He hardly ever compliments me and when he does it feels very forced and like he is only doing it because I have told him it hurts my feelings that he doesn‚Äôt. I‚Äôve talked to him about this before and he told me that he is attracted to me, but his actions still feel off to me. 

What should I do? Have any of you been in similar situations?"
"my parents are southern conservative christians &amp; i am definitely an atheist. most of my friends are hardcore conspiracy theorist &amp; get offended if i say i believe things based on evidence ??? not much of a question here, just venting. it‚Äôs fucking annoying having to tip toe around everyone in my life bc i‚Äôm worried of offending them."
"So, I have this bit of an idea in my head and it feels very risky, so I need some advice on it. There‚Äôs this girl I‚Äôve liked for a long time (I‚Äôm in love with her more or less) and I wanna ask her to my valentine. But I wanna approach as just as friends and not from a romantic point of view. I don‚Äôt wanna escalate the situation or anything, but how do I do this without compromising myself?"
"A month ago we (40m/39f) were building a life together (for over 2 years). Integrating our families. Regular date nights and lazy weekends together. Even a shared cat.

Then new years rolls around and she has a week to herself. Comes back and mentions things are hard. Then a couple of weeks of rolling back on us and then breaks it all off. Too hard. I'm better off without her. No real explanation. And I'm basically stunned.

I'm not going to get a real answer to why. My heads realing with possibilities but at the end of the day it is what it is and I'm not going to get closure from her. And it's not her job to give it.

So how do I stop my head spinning and move on? Because right now I am not coping well."
"I support LGBTQ relationships. However my sister (28f) is in a Polyamorous relationship and I do not feel comfortable with that. It is not because it is my sister, but rather I feel uncomfortable with Polyamorous relationships for anyone. Can some people share their perspectives on this?"
"Hello all! So I got a test and received my NHS text message saying I‚Äôve got covid, the only thing I‚Äôm worried about is my bosses don‚Äôt know I went for a test, I went for one purely as both of my bosses got it and I‚Äôve been feeling beyond off recently and because I live at home didnt want to risk my mum giving it to her mum when she sees her in the next few days. The reason I‚Äôm worried is one of the directors who  is off is the only other person who does my job so I have no idea what happens with people getting paid etc as we both work in accounts, and to make situations worse both my bosses are my auntie and uncle, I just don‚Äôt want to feel I‚Äôve gone behind their back and screwed them and their company over during these hard times, any advice?:-("
I‚Äôm 20 (m) with a girlfriend who‚Äôs 22. She lives a bit far away from me and works full time. I‚Äôm a full time student and barely have any time to visit her. I like her but I‚Äôm not getting what I need emotionally or physically from the relationship and would like to break things off I just don‚Äôt really know how to go about doing that in a way the doesn‚Äôt make me seem like a complete tool. Does anyone have any advice for me. I also have some options closer to where I‚Äôm living but I‚Äôm not sure if they‚Äôll even play out I‚Äôm just kinda afraid of being alone again with nobody to talk to.
"I met my girlfriend and treatment, she‚Äôs really beautiful and I‚Äôm starting to care more and more about her. We both have pretty bad mental issues. Anyways, she seems to bottle it up a bit. Even went to inpatient once without telling me, she acted she was fine and then attempted suicide. Maybe we just need to date for longer for her to get more open but I just want to make sure she‚Äôs okay. How can I be there for her? How can I make her as comfortable as possible about opening up to me? I don‚Äôt want her to feel like she‚Äôd be a burden or anything."
"My boyfriend seems to like if I‚Äôm clingy or I message him a lot. Idk why but I feel it in my gut that he does. If I ask him to hang out he will say persuade me or possibly or maybe so I beg. Or if he asks me to do something he will say ‚Äúshow me how bad you want me‚Äù or he will tell me to persuade him again.

How do I kind of play into this? Why does he do this?"
"I honestly don‚Äôt even know what to say. He (27M) has always said he‚Äôs a feminist and all about treating women right. Through an ig post that he didn‚Äôt think I‚Äôd (26 F) see I was finally able to confirm that he went on a date with a girl from Tinder / Hinge. On the Friday before Valentine‚Äôs Day of all days. We have been together for 3 months and he swore up and down that he isn‚Äôt like ‚Äúthose other guys‚Äù. I really never thought I‚Äôd be in this situation bc I trusted him so much. 

Do I cut him off completely ? Send him screenshots ? Do I wait until I see him in person ? How would I even bring this up ? If anyone could give me specific verbiage, that would be ideal."
