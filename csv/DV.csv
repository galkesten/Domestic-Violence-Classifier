"He's hit me before in the past. Maybe I was being a bitch, but then he raised his hand at me as if to hit me, and I flinched rrally bad. Then he laughed at me amd called me a bitch"
"I remember putting in my calendar. One the first of this month, a reminder went off for me to find you a present you would love. Now is the day you were born. You're the same age as me now.

What a terrible day.

If we were still dating, I would be texting you ""Happy birthday baby!!💕🎂""

I would spend the whole day with you, cuddling, eating cake, and celebrating you, someone I thought was a kind person. Isn't that something?

I know what you are doing right now. Sitting in that chair, staring at your screen, behind your messy and smudged glasses, smelling of body odor from refusing to shower.

God, I hate you so much.

Hey guys, fun fact. She once verbally abused me to the point of tears, left the call, and it turns out she started to stream on her fucking youtube channel.

Isn't that something?

Well, □□□, I hope you have a shitty birthday with a cake filled with glass and a horrible life."

"My wife wanted to talk about our relationship last night, she said that I'd been distant for a few days and kept asking me why and what was wrong?

I explained everything I wrote about in my last post and explained what had been upsetting me and what had been making me feel the way I am, and even said to her that I felt so upset, I'd been seeking advice and made my original post and when I got it all out, I felt so much better.

She acknowledged that she shouldn't be treating me the way she has and promised to change, she even said that she never wanted me to feel this bad that I was seeking advice and making the post I made on here.

She also said that there were some things we both had to change and mentioned how little I do around the house and that she maybe acted the way she did because of how tired she was after having to do most of the work in the house and work from home and look after our daughter and we both explained what we wanted going forward so that we can both work together for a stronger relationship.

I am so happy and feel like this could be a turning point in our relationship.

Thank you so much for anyone who read my last post or gave advice, it helped me to speak to her and be honest when she asked me what was wrong."
"I’m in no way discounting other forms of abuse, please note that.

I realized today that abuse with a romantic partner is some other wacky level of fucked up because you chose to be with that person in the first place, triggering an endless mind game cycle of self blame. Thoughts like “what’s wrong with ME for staying, I’M so fucked up for failing for this person, I’M weak for not being able to leave them.” 

Whereas with family abuse you were unfortunately born into it. You didn’t choose it at first. Just awful. 

Nonetheless both are incredibly fucked up and one is not worse than the other, it all sucks. 

This probably makes no sense but it’s something I’ve been thinking about. And also makes me more proud of choosing to leave an abusive romantic relationship and never to return again. I chose to stay, but I also chose to leave. 

To anyone who is hurting, you have the strength to leave. There are people who are willing to help if you want. You will find a way. The next ten steps may seem daunting or impossible, so don’t focus on the next ten. Focus on the first step and the rest will come easier."

"TW rape, DV, suicide 

TLDR; I think he’s trying to make me think he killed himself but I’m scared. 


He’s finally gone. I knew it was coming. Small back story: Been with ‘Bob’ for a while. Not the father of my 21 month old but plays father role and is so good to her! They are besties. Anyways, we are engaged. We live in my parents basement suite. I’m 21 he is 25. They love him. But that’s because they don’t know the truth. 

He has a mind blowing alcohol addiction. It’s nothing like ive ever seen. He turns EVIL when he’s drunk. Pulls me around by my hair, r*pes me, hits me, screams at me, calls me horrific names and says absolutely horrendous things to me. But I put up with it because I almost craved the love bombing, as fucked up as it seems. I have never been in a healthy relationship so I had no idea what I was doing. 

The last straw was tonight. I had an unexpected tooth problem and had to have emergency surgery. I found out at work and panicked (who likes the dentist??) so I texted him telling him I was bleeding in my mouth badly and needed emergency surgery and I was so afraid. I asked him to come with me &amp; my mother would watch the baby. He says of course!!! Duh he’s my fiancé and would do ANYTHING for me. Anyways he gets off work about 45 minutes away and says he has to make 2 quick stops then straight home to drive me. I say okay! No big deal. 
10 minutes later he calls and says he can no longer drive me but will pick me up. My heart dropped. Turns out he needed to hangout with his friend, Rhys, to buy weed. I said “okay” and hung up. I almost threw up from the sadness. It sucked. I go alone and he starts blowing up my phone with screen shots of a recent selfie I put on Instagram wearing a shirt where you could see my cleavage. He was texting me:
“what the fuck is this”, “delete it NOW”, “what is wrong with you”

I’ll admit I did post that to piss him off because I knew deep down I was done and had nothing to lose. I calmly deleted it, not to please him but because I low-key wanted to have my dramatic exit when he got home. Lol. I’ve thought about how I’d do it soo many times. 

He comes home hours later, absolutely PISSED. So drunk. Holding a bouquet of flowers. He immediately starts yelling at me for turning off my location on my phone (again, did that to kind of piss him off which is immature I know). I tell him to get the fuck out. He starts saying that he was WORKING LATE and was buying us half his company &amp; now we were millionaires. It was absurd to say the least. When he’s that drunk he doesn’t even have logic, he didn’t remember telling me he was buying weed (which then turned into drinking apparently). 

My toddler starts screaming from bed (he woke her up from yelling which happens often). I slapped him across the face when he then said ‘why would I be sorry I have nothing to be sorry for’. I feel awful. I don’t want to be that person. My mother heard all this and ran down and grabbed my daughter and I ran after then and yelled “HES LEAVING” so he could heard. 

He then made a call and I could hear him talking shit about me.  My ego was crushed obviously but it was all untrue, we have no mutual friends and anyone who knows him knows he’s a raging drunk that has anger issues. 

He left, drove away drunk as per usual. He has had 2 DUIs and just got his license back in feb 2021. 
I always call him in to the cops when he drunk drives. Never done it (drunk driving) with my daughter in the car might I add. Still not acceptable in anyway but I tried everything to stop him. I texted him apologizing for slapping him &amp; wishing him luck with his ‘new company’. He started spam calling me on random numbers and texted me ‘suicidal now thanks’. He has used that threat before. The calls/texts have stopped. Should I be worried?

Thanks for reading"
Is it often that a narcissist in a relationship tells their partner that they are a narcissist themselves? Why is this and how can you tell who is truly at fault?
"I was 18 when we met, he was a few years older. I had very low self esteem and zero confidence. I’m sure he saw that and got in as quick as he could. Before we even went on our first date I knew what it would turn into. I left my phone in the other room and missed a few texts and calls. I thought it would be in my favor to take a break to come off as less clingy. However he was livid. I don’t remember what he said exactly. But I know that I cried and thought to my self I guess this is how abusive relationships are. At the time I thought, no problem. I’ll just always respond right away and things will be fine. I had this mindset that if I just did everything right then we’d be okay. 

Never think that’s because someone is attractive and appears good on the surface that you should hold on to it. None of it will matter. 

Even though I tried my absolute hardest to be perfect, he would always find something to complain about. My bra strap was showing, I was too friendly to a cashier. I glanced in the direction of another guy. Or the default complaint, I had attitude. If I seem bothered the slightest bit he’d flip out. 

Maybe you think it’s not a big deal and you can take it. That will not last. I hated myself. I felt worthless. I was willing to let someone abuse me, and yet eventually it became too much. You may think that’s a good thing. But the damage had already Been done. It’s hard to explain how it feels. It’s like your brain gets rewired. He gets mad, I get sad and even though i know I’m not wrong and that he’s absolutely not right. My brain still tells me that to fix my agonizing sadness I need to fix us. I can’t be okay unless we are okay. So even when I argue back it doesn’t matter. And as you can imagine things just get worse. And yet I’m still here ten years later. And I don’t think illver be abl e to leave. 
Please don’t be like me. I am forever ruined. Forever depressed and so so tired physically and emotionally. I have crippling anxiety. I have been to the ER and I have heard every insult imaginable. However bad you think it’ll be by leaving them, it won’t be as bad as staying"
"My bf(38m) keeps telling me(30f), during arguments, how alone he feels. This absolutely hurts my heart because I do so much for him. I try so hard, and love him so much, which he knows. 
He thinks we have communication issues. I think he has an anger issue that triggers me and causes a shutdown(I feel like he constantly corrected or is frustrated at me all the time and my feelings get really hurt).
Anyways, this is deeply concerning me. Has anyone felt this way? Had an so tell them this? Did it mean the end or were you able to work through it?"
" 

Okay, I'm sharing this because I honestly don't know what to do, I need advice and to anyone who even reads this or is kind enough to give advice, thank you. I also wanna know if I'm crazy too. So buckle up this is quite the story...

So 2 and a half years ago I started dating my abusive ex, we barely knew each other, met at a party both of us were extremely depressed and in bad home situations. He started staying at my mom's place with me without her permission almost everyday. Around 2 months I started seeing red flags that I chose to ignore, and of course we got a cat (who we'll call S), I say we as in it was a decision we both made but I took care of her for the next 6 months pretty much by myself, bought her food, litter, toys, collar, took care of her and her litter, she lived in my room for the first 6 months of her life. I got into a lot of fights with my mom to keep S, and then my mom dropped the bombshell that we were moving to the city to live closer to her abusive boyfriend. I obliviously fought this and didn't want to move, after a lot of back and forth on what we should do, my mom signed over our 2 bed 1 bath to my brother who wanted to help me and my ex (18M at the time) to stay in our town and together.

We lived in terrible conditions, 5 people in a 2 bed 1 bath, 4 of the 5 being jobless, part of this being because of covid. Me (16F at the time) was the only employed member of the household, the place was always trashed, infested with roaches, everyone was always on edge during this time, everyone was always high or drunk. my ex got S sprayed in his name (his mom set it up) but during this whole time I was in charge of food for everyone living there, and all the cat food and litter.

I should start talking about what made it abusive. Well when we started dating it was ""perfect"" and ""true love"", just kidding it was just a narcissist love-bombing a stupid 16 year old. after about 2 months that when he started getting angry, and not normal angry he would start screaming, most of the time at me. He started throwing thing and punching himself, getting physical with me.

&amp;#x200B;

   He started just abandoning me for hours or days, something would happen to make him upset he would start screaming at me, I would start crying and apologizing trying to make things better, (I tried everything) and he would leaving say he was gonna kill himself and send me into a panic attack. If he started screaming at me because there was no food I stopped eating, if someone woke him up I was up at all hours keeping people quiet, if he was screaming at me because he lost something, I was searching for it alone and then added it to the list of his shit I kept track of. Anytime I tried to stand up for myself it was one of 3 things. 1 Cry about how he hates himself 2 gaslight me telling me I was crazy and over reacting or 3 threaten to kill himself. I never talked to anyone about it, I lied because I was scared of breaking up, I told everyone I loved him and I was ashamed. Ashamed I had lied, I wanted to make it work so bad that I kept lying to myself saying ""this is fine and normal, couples fight whatever"" but you don't say ""I hate you you make me wanna kill myself"" to your partner, you don't pressure your partner to have sex when they don't want too and the few times they say no you don't start screaming at them. I can't even express the hurt in those moments anyone who's been in an abusive relationship knows it hurts more because they know you best and use that against you. He verbally abused me everyday and had physically abused me on a couple instances. Along with shit talking on all of my friends and complaining about any of my friends who hung out or lived with us, but then let 2 guys with no jobs who were always stealing and drugged out. (they stole a goat once no shit)

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

So back of track after another 8 months or so we go another cat who we'll call N, during this entire time I bought all they're food and litter, changed their food, water, litter everyday, if washed the bowls and put ice in their water. I also payed for N's Spray with my tax returns but it was done in my exs name (set by his mom again) I loved and cared for them all the time they were the only things that kept my going everyday I was there, I didn't wanna get up but I did for them, to feed and water them.

And now the breakup, I'll try to keep this short because I've already gone on for a while. I tried to break up multiple times, every time I stayed because of the threats of suicide. 2 months before we actually broke up he left for 2 day cause I didn't wanna fuck (said I could have fun paying for the apartment without him).

&amp;#x200B;

   That's why I lost feelings I just didn't care anymore because I knew I wasn't in the wrong. I had this friend (17M we'll call him GB for good boyfriend) who became my boyfriend literally right after me and my ex broke up, he was there for me as a friend that entire time and I'm so thankful for that, he helped me navigate my feelings and he still does. But 2 months after I tried to break up he said something that made me lose it. 

&amp;#x200B;

Text at 1:10 pm Where are you 

at 1:12pm WHERE THE FUCK ARE 

1:13pm YOU AT 

1:18pm IF YOU'RE NOT GONNA RESPOND DONT COME HOME

I was so done, so drained and tired.. so I didn't I stayed out hung out with my friends and festered, about all the shit he'd done to me all the shit he'd said and I worked up the courage to break up for good. Then literally right after GB confessed and I was so happy because I had a crush on him for like 2 months previous to me and my ex breaking up. I never told anyone or acted on it and I hated myself for having it, but hey dreams come true, just not how you pictured them. It wasn't long until everyone else figured out and when it did hell broke lose, everyone thought we'd been cheating the whole time and all of a sudden we turn into the bad guys. They gave me my stuff in bag with cat shit and roach traps (they argued they didn't even have to give any of my stuff back). When throwing me out he said ""The cats will never forgive you for this"".

&amp;#x200B;

I stayed for a another friend who lived close by for a month after. There was a lot of screaming and fighting between me and my ex after we settled and talked out what we would do, he came to me about 7 times talking about his issues and I genuinely helped him even if he hurt me I maturely helped him gave him advice only for him to help convince my temporary roommate to kick me out, I almost slept on the streets and had to couch hop for a week until I was able to go to my aunt and uncles house who said if I can find a way to get them I could keep my cats. 

&amp;#x200B;

  The last time me and my ex time was to talk about the cats I haven't seen them in almost 2 months and it breaks my heart that I can't see them and I don't think it's fair. My ex said he could never take them away from me but has basically ghosted me, everyone who is on his side refuses to talk to me now and I don't know why. They told me to move on and forget about it but they're my babies, how do you just forget about your babies? I took care of them bought thing for them. Please I just don't know what to do and want to care for them and keep them safe, if you have any advice it would be greatly apprenticed I miss my babies.... I left a lot there and have already said goodbye, but I can't say goodbye to them, please help..."

"I finally felt comfortable enough to fall asleep in front of a guy. I have been out of the relationship with my abusive ex for almost 2 years. A friend invited me to a lake house with his family and on one of the days there I was really tired so I laid down on their couch while everyone but him and I were out of the home. He was sitting at the edge of the couch on his phone and I told him I was going to rest for a sec, next thing I knew I was waking up 45 minutes later. I wasn't even anxious or upset after when I woke up. I can't even sleep in front of my own mother comfortably.

TLDR: I TRUSTED SOMEONE ENOUGH TO GO TO SLEEP IN FRONT OF THEM!! 
A GUY! HOLY SHIT THAT IS SUCH AN IMPROVEMENT!!!"

"I'm feeling very down,I've been struggling with depression and anxiety the past 4 years, I've finally began to recover and feel better, this year i started looking for jobs and I'm currently working a few hours, but during this time my stepdad has been abusive to me and my mom ,he suggested 3 years ago that i should move in with my mom ( and obviously him too) he is now saying that there's nothing wrong with me even when he himself saw me and acknowledged my struggles, he's also threatening to kick me out, he has said several times he wants me to move out of my room so he can rent it and now he's saying he wants me to pay him rent even when he knows i cannot afford it since I'm just doing a couple of hours weekly while I work myself up to be able to work more hours..i feel scared, lost, vulnerable, i feel like I'm on the verge of being homeless,i don't know what to do,my therapist is witness of how hard I've worked and how far I've come but what can she do for me? What else can I do?"

"I think I could win an award for the show I put on for everyone else everyday. It’s exhausting. I still cry everyday. I don’t have daily panic attacks anymore, so that’s great. I go to work everyday with a smile on my face. I whistle, sing, dance, and act like I’m the same happy person they’ve known for years. I do the same for my son when I get home. I go to bed early every night. I look forward to going to bed. Sometimes I have to force myself to wait until the sun at least goes down. I just realized today that I most likely will never be in another relationship. I don’t know how I would possibly ever be able to believe a man if he told me something nice. How I could ever trust again. The fear of having the absolute pain my heart is feeling right now again is unimaginable."
"DISCLAMER Timeline isn't fully correct due to it being a copy and paste from my other post in r/aita which was deleted. I also added extra details here 

let's meet our cast

Me (16f)
Sister or S for short (19f)
And sisters bf or SP (20M)

Basically our story is years and years long but yesterday I reached my breaking point. 

For years my S and I hated each other for as long as I remember. She used to beat the absolute crap out of me. She even broke 2 bones in my arm by jumping on me. At this age I was about 11 years old. She also made fun of my boyfriend (16M) for being Polish and made so many holocaust jokes to him. He hated all of that. I blamed myself for what happened because it happened during an argument we were having. It has happened multiple times. Shit like this has happened for years.  I was also told to get over it when she ate candy and other treats I or my parents got for me. She also hated me for breaking my arm on ""her special day"" which was her leaving to England to live with her now ex. Her ex abused her physically and my good sister paid to bring her home. My good sister has an autistic son so she obviously has better ways to spend her money. And my sister refused to give back the money and even stopped contact with her because she doesn't want to pay her back. Even making fun of my nephew who is 3 and on the autism spectrum. SP also screamed at me as loud as he possibly could due to an argument me and S had  Another time she grabbed me by my hair and slammed my head of stuff like our front door or walls. She also like to make fun of me for my self harm 

So let's get to the start of me breaking. 3 days ago I was so happy because I made these amazing brownies. My sister and her boyfriend ate the entire fucken plate as they always do. It pisssed me off so much.

2 days ago Italy played England. My sister and her bf were wanting England to win because she's English. I wanted Italy to win. When England lost they were upset but I was happy and this drove them insane. I said ""it's coming Rome"" and she decided to say something about Poland.

Yesterday my sister kept calling me names like 4 eyes which she knows hurt me a lot because I'm self conscious. And she made other comments throughout the day and physically hurting me. So I told my mom that it's me or them and I shouldn't have to deal with it at the age of 16 when she's 19. I ran out the house. And people were searching for me for a couple hours. My mom eventually found me. I talked about it with my parents afterwards and the talk really helped. 

I've been avoiding her at all costs. I had to kick her out of my room twice so far. The first was yesterday when she was forced to say sorry by our mom. I kicked her out and told her sorry doesn't make up for years. And today she just walked in wanting to talk to my mom and I kicked her out again. 

I'm so confused on what I should do here. I need all the advice I can get

Sorry for the bad layout I was so sad and angry writing it.
TLDR my sister emotionally and physically abused me"
"To send your abuser to jail? I know I could, I have evidence, he threatens me and my family all the time, he hits me and calls me names, but I still can’t bring myself to not feel guilty over sending him to jail. He might lose his dog since nobody else will take it and I am moving and can’t take it with me. But when I try to leave without involving police he hurts me. He kicked me in the back yesterday so hard. He has punched, kicked, pushed, hit, among other things to me and I know it is wrong. But then he talks about how wrong it would be to send him to jail or anything of the sort. Is that just him being a manipulative abuser? What should I do"
I feel like I'm going to have to research out and be vulnerable for this with my own intimate feelings. I'm kind of in a abusive relationship with myself.
"I had found a woman on OkCupid. She was a student at Georgia State that had just graduated and she was from Thailand looking for work here in the USA. I had clear expectations of what I wanted and I would not settle for less. She was kind, caring, genuine, affectionate, and listened and was encouraging. Before long, we cooked for each other taking turns at my place then hers, and we also went on many weekend trips and restaurant outings together. We did everything together. I waited a long time to move in together because my past still haunted me. I wanted to be certain. Eventually, after careful thought, I moved in and then soon after we married. We bought our first home together and I felt like we had the world in our hands and that we could do anything together. Alas, to my surprise, everything started to slowly erode away. Not 2 months after the wedding, she started turning into a different person, she started having fits of anger and disrespecting me not only in private but in public. She would try to talk over me when I was handling everyday responsibilities that involved consulting a professional of some sort. This made me feel small and un-masculine. She talked down to me as if I was for some reason supposed to submit to her. When her Thai friend’s husband who is also Caucasian, had come over for dinner with us, she offered him the head of the table and acted like it was no big deal. When it’s her PMC time of the month,  her emotions are so out of control that she bashed things, throws things, slams doors, hits me, punches me, bites me, and digs her claws into my body while I’m driving if I refuse to do what she wants because she is showing signs of aggression that could get out of control. That very last part happened to me recently. I am blown away at how after she finally calms down, she acts like nothing happened, waits it out, doesn’t say sorry and then if I don’t act like it never happened and all is well, she tries to manipulate as act like it’s my fault. She has no empathy, remorse, no sense of right nor wrong and repeatedly tells me that I deserve it and if I wouldn’t of ruined her outing by choosing to distance myself from her to deescalate the situation, then she wouldn’t of hit, bite and dug her nails into my body. Instead of defending myself in a physical way like I had done in my prior 4 year non martial relationship, I decided to just let her make herself look like a angry fool while she beat me and bitten me and dug her nails in my body while I calmly drove us back home to try to distance myself from her by locking myself in my office room. I had decided not to physically defend myself unless she was going to hit me close to my eyes or come at me with a knife or something like that. Asian women seem to appear to be ultra feminine, slender, meek and helpless and soft meek and sweet voice on the outside. If I had struck her to attempt to get her to stop, who is an officer going to believe even though I have collected pictures of my injuries, audio recordings and medical files of attempting to get her mental instability checked out? Me being the man, I would be thrown in jail because I’m a man and I’m taller and bigger than her. Heck, my Uncle’s wife is from Indonesia. She apparently acts the same way and even tried to get my Uncle fired from his job as a means for her to attempt to control him. When my Wife had beaten, bitten me, screamed at me and dug her nails in my skin in the car last weekend, and then told me that this is what happens when you don’t do what I say, I told her straight up. “ I am an American United States born and raised citizen. I do not bow to foreigners nor any person except for Jesus Christ himself. So go ahead, do your worst because I will never submit to a woman in this manner. I have self respect and love for myself. I am not a submissive Asian male that you can push around like you are accustomed to. You’d do well to remember that. But just remember, there are consequences to your actions and one day either by judge in this life or the next, your actions will be held accountable.” A week later and she hasn’t apologized nor had one ounce of remorse or sense of guilt and shame. In a big way, I think this whole situation has buffed off all the emotional turmoil that my mom had put on me as a child. I have become emotionally hardened, but not unloving nor disconnected. I have also learned that love is something you can give to yourself and that I don’t need to chase a women’s love to feel loved and to feel confident and whole. I am now at a crossroads in my life about whether to stay and try invest another year to work things out or to cut my losses and divorce. If I do divorce which seems very likely now more than ever, I am very content with staying single and not dating. Just focusing on healing and staying focused on my purpose in life, not getting distracted by the seductions of women. I don’t hate women, but I am soooo not interested anymore."
"I met this guy almost 3 years ago, I had been in 2 previous relationships before him which I never had a problem with they just didn’t work out it was never nothing compared to the hell that I was put through with this guy. He messaged me on Facebook and we started talking from there I thought he was a really nice guy and after a month or so we finally hung out. It was the best time of my life I really fell head over heels for this man. So we officially started dating and I did ignore all the red flags because of how much I liked him. He never showed me off, never bought me flowers, never actually showed me how much he claimed he loved me through out the 3 years because “I piss him off” I remember the first time we got in a argument and he yelled at me in a way that I had never been yelled at before by anybody, I ran outside and told him we were done and he begged me to stay and He apologized and said it would never happen again but it always did. The arguments would start because I said the wrong thing, he didn’t like the way I think, I was too stupid. It was like walking on eggshells I felt like I didn’t know what to say to not piss him off. We would fight to the point of him screaming in my face and having his parents come check on us and it’s like they didn’t even have control of him either, he was very disrespectful towards his parents so what did I expect. The amount of times he would call me a c*** a stupid b**** it was too much I was being called the whole name in the book. Then that’s when he started putting his hands on me and I would constantly tell him there’s no reason for me to have bruises on my body because I’m being shoved, he would push me to fall, even drag me by my hair. He would smack me, He would squeeze my arms really hard to the point of me having his finger tips marked in my arms. Keep in mind I’m only 5’1 and I weight around 120 and he was around 5’6 weighted around 145. When he would apologize about the abuse he would say it wasn’t a big deal because he never “punched me” and that I was just being a baby and super dramatic and that I would fall on purpose. I started having really bad anxiety and my heart would start raising as soon as I knew he was gonna loose his temper and scream at me. It’s like when we were good it was amazing but when we fought it was the worst. Then he started texting other girls, downloading dating sites. He would text girls while I was in bed with him and when I would confront him about it his excuse was “because I never listen, he can do whatever he wants” I would literally cry to this man about how much it hurted my feelings that he needed to message other people while being with me or he would also say “it’s not a big deal” I think it’s gonna take a while for me to be able to trust and love someone again. The amount of horrible situations I was put in even had me thinking it was actually my fault, like I deserved it. The process of healing will be long but I know I can do this. I just hope in the future I find someone who treats me the way I’m supposed to be treated. I haven’t told anybody about the things I was put through but it feels good letting it out here."

"This happened years ago, but I'm still not sure what to make of it...

I hadn't spent time with my ex boyfriend in nearly a year, and decided I was ready to hangout with him  alone in his dorm room. After a bit of talking and catching up, he begins to put his hands on my legs. I move him off of me and say something along the lines of ""no, we're not going to do this."" We are obviously comfortable with each other considering we dated in the past, so he persists and continues to touch me as I move him away and repeatedly say things like ""stop it"", ""don't want to"". I know I should have left at this moment. But I stay and we start watching some shit like Black Panther and he pulls me to lay down with him and I do it. At this point I know he will not take no for an answer so I allow him to continue touching me without doing anything in response. He then tries to kiss me, but I try to draw a line again, say ""no"", pull away and give every indicator both verbal and non-verbal that I do not want to. Eventually, I give up and kiss him. This same cycle of saying no and giving up keeps repeating until we have sex.

I know it sounds bad, but it's very hard for me to accept that I was sexually assaulted by my ex boyfriend who was once so sweet and loving towards me. I would never want to label him as a person who did this to me, but I did not initiate any touching and said no numerous times. I could have gotten up and left at any point, but he still had emotional power over me and I didn't want to make him mad.

He hasn't treated me well for years after this happened, so I think I might be ready to accept the reality of who his is. Did he sexually assault me?"
"But then I think about the time I was having an argument in the kitchen with my ex while I was cooking/prepping a meal. He blatantly told me that he wished I would charge at him with the knife I was using, that way he could take it from me and stab me instead. The shitty thing is through that whole ordeal I was in tears thinking about how much I just wanted to cut myself so he would stop treating me that way, so I could end the belittling words coming from his mouth. Hurting him was the last thing on my mind, but to him hurting me was at the top of his list."

"I obviously deserve someone who doesn’t beat me, yell at me, gaslight me, shake my family down for money, hound my friends and family down to try to fuck them, talks down to me, trashes my car, and makes me feel like shit. 

You. Are. A. DOG. And you’ve been running around my life tearing things up and shitting on everything for too long. Goodbye and remember that you are a HORRIBLE PERSON who deserves the giant karma bitchslap that’s coming to you. Good luck finding a dumber girl who loves herself somehow as little as I did to excuse all your awful behavior. 

I’m glad I’m in a better place now and wouldn’t find myself in this situation again. I love my beautiful self too much to allow abuse ever again. ❤️‍🩹"
"I left an abusive relationship in January. I’ve been working so hard in therapy and on self reflection and growth these past months. In the last month I’ve really started to realize the extent of the abuse I endured, but I also have had some major breakthroughs in terms of learning to honour myself and my intuition and my boundaries. 

I have had a few ongoing casual relationships in the past few months and I recently made the decision to end one where I was starting to get actual feelings. I didn’t end it *because* of said feelings, but because I found out the man in question was a serious bully in high school. I asked him about it somewhat indirectly because the person I found out from asked me not to share their identity, but his response was pretty instantly “I don’t think I was a bully at all”. It took a couple weeks but I realized this isn’t the kind of person I want to be my partner. I want to be with someone who is kind and honest and takes responsibility for his wrong doings. Plus it makes me think he hasn’t really changed since then and he probably still is a bully. So I chalked up the niceties to love bombing and ended things. 

Maybe this seems like a small feat but it feels like a huge show of my growth in the last year. I’m honouring myself. I’m honouring my values. I’m honouring my boundaries. 

Now, I’ve met someone who is already in therapy and has been for quite some time. He’s worked through his baggage and at this point it’s all maintenance but to him that’s still important. He’s also kind, patient, and we have a very similar sense of humour. We’ve only had one date so far, but we’ve been texting endlessly and that one date was like 8 hours! I also made a choice I haven’t made possibly ever. I definitely *wanted* to have sex with him, and he felt the same, but I said to him that if hooking up was all he was interested in I was down, but if he wanted to explore a relationship I wanted to wait. He agreed, we didn’t have sex and he was so in tune with my body language. I felt safe and respected, more so than I have in a really long time. I feel hopeful."
"I packed up all of my stuff Friday while my girlfriend(32) was at work and left to my parents. She came home and was absolutely livid. I made the mistake of letting my feeling back and guilty of doing that to her get to me. So I talked to her all weekend and even video called her last night. The video call, no surprise ended in an argument. An argument about me not answering her phone call that morning. I was talking to my nephew, I texted her and said I'd call her in 5-10 minutes. She was mad and said to not call her. Claiming she sees where her priority in my life is. I called her back and she didn't answer, I didn't get mad or question anything like she did. 

I packed up and left because three weeks ago marked the third time in three months where she got mad enough to get physically violent. The violence ended in me needing to defend myself and threaten calling the police. She had my phone and a knife, she's also taken my credit card, wallet and car key without consent or me knowing in the past after we fought. 

I am also not allowed to have any female friends, she questions me about how many females are in my college class. While also repeatedly saying how I'll either cheat on or leave her once I get my career job. Is it me, or is controlling with trust issues and jealousy? I'm sure there's more in there as well. 

I know I haven't been perfect and I'm sure things I have done over the last few months have caused some of these issues, the trust, jealousy etc. But I've never done anything like this until I got in a relationship with her. So I'm not sure if how she is drove me to do so or what. She's trying to get me to come back today after my class. I feel like that would be a mistake, wouldn't it? Shouldn't I just end it and not get sucked back in and possibly stuck again? Then have to repeat what I did this past weekend?

Thanks for any insight and help!"
"TLDR - hes in jail and I need to officially leave him. 

I hope i dont get alot of hate for this, and I want to start out by saying I know cheating is wrong and I feel terrible. 

Me, f18 - boyfriend, m21

I won't bore you with all the details of my relationship but we were together for 2 years, he abused me physically and mentally. He lied about everything and hid everything from me. Cheated on me so many times i can't even count. In the beginning of our relationship he was texting atleast 20 girls trying to hookup. Then he wouldn't stop watching porn. (I know not everyone considers this cheating, but I told him many times it hurts me). He has a temper and serious anger problems, always acting out by screaming, violence, breaking things. He never sexually assaulted me but there were times i did NOT want to have sex and he would say ""do you want me to watch porn?"" So I would. Even when I didn't want to. 

This year in April, his friend texted me and said ""you know your boyfriend sucks dick for money right?"" And sent me a video of him sucking him off. He also said he drove him to cheat with other girls, then brought him back to my house. I confronted him and he said he only did it because he was homeless and needed money. So I began to think he is gay or bi, and I also found alot of transgender porn on his phone before. (Of people with a penis and fake boobs.) Long story short there was a huge fight and he swears on his grave he is not attracted to men. Honestly, I dont believe it. And he was homeless when we first met (didn't know at first) and he started living with me. I live with my mom and in late April she kicked him out after being tired of us fighting and saw me with a black eye. 

We didn't break up, but i was moving on. He had a warrant for missing a court date on a possession of Marijuana charge. We called and texted everyday but I was happier alone. I downloaded a dating app and met somebody I really like in July. 3 days ago, he was arrested for driving with no liscense and his warrant. I do feel horrible for cheating, but part of me feels like ""he cheated on me so why does it matter if I meet one person"". Im not justifying cheating. I know its wrong and please don't hate me for it. This new guy has a job, car, owns a house and mentally stable. Everything my ex was not. Im ready to move on to this new relationship, but as I said hes in jail and I have to break up with him. Im going to write him a letter but I dont even know what to say. Im also scared for the day he gets out because most of his belongings are still at my house, packed and ready to go. Any ideas on what I should write in this letter? Without just saying ""im leaving you for someone better, bye"" Thanks for anyone who read this all."
"For context- I just turned 16 and I live with a narcissist who has been harming me and my sister since childhood. My sister is now 23 and I'm 16. Our abuser is still married to our other parent, and I'm pretty sure their scared of them too. My family knows but anytime they have tried doing something in the past, they were met with the parent threatening to hurt themself or me/my sister, or have been met with them saying we were faking it and were crazy. Any time I've tried to look for help, I tell myself I'm the problem and that if I leave them, they would be alone and would be upset- but now I don't care if that's true or not. I just want to be happy and be in a healthy environment. 

What is the safest way to do this without causing as many problems as possible? If I do have to leave and this does have to be taken to court or if it leads to my parents losing custody of me, I have places to stay and accuse to resources to keep me safe. I just need help getting this process started."
"He paid for dinner without hestitation.

He respected my boundaries when I said I don't want to move fast. 

He actually was interested in talking about my hobbies and career, and was committed to the convo we were having.

He was very chill and not argumentative with me or others (that I observed on our date). 

He already said he would drive to meet for our ""next"" date since I drove to meet him for our first date (compromise). 

He actually doesn't drink much and cares about his health (my ex was an alch and relied on drinking always)

It's honestly so weird and tbh it makes me uncomfortable how opposite he was. I'm so used to begging for attention and wanting to be being valued. Tbh this kid seems more boring but that could be bc I'm so used to chaos.

Now again this kid could end up different, but I'm more keen and aware of red flags now and seeing them clearly. I have no expectations of any relationship."
"How do you accept and love yourself again after being put in such an awful situation for so long? We expect the person to change or see the error of their ways, but they never do. 

For fuck’s sake every holiday was spent alone because I was never prioritized, I was seen as a mere option. When I voiced these concerns, she got upset and gave me the silent treatment til my birthday which was not even acknowledged one bit. Yet I brushed it off like a dumbass because I didn’t want to upset her. 

Yet when the excuses were too much and I stood up for myself, I get ghosted without any notice at all. Her friend said I’m toxic and my gifts weren’t expensive enough for my ex. I’ll never get that closure or truth as to why she abused me when I was the only man not to cheat on her or be controlling towards her. 

If I’m not good enough for her, who’s to say I’m good enough to date anyone? If you date someone for almost 2 years and ghost them for a valid concern then I give up on humanity let alone dating."
"TW - sexual assault/ abuse (including childhood SA), suicide, alcohol, drugs, emotionally and physically abusive ex

TLDR - A bunch of shitty things my ex did and me just realising how bad it was - but also not sure if I'm really the bad person

So im 22 now and we started dating when we were 16 and in the same classes together at 6th form. I was diagnosed at the time with ptsd from childhood sexual abuse and also from emotionally/ psychologically abusive parents. So I was really vulnerable and trying to deal with everything alone as a 16 year old basically. When we first got to know eachother, I kissed 2 boys at different parties that he didn't go to. The thing is we only just started talking and looking back I think that was me trying to signal that he should back off without me having to express myself because he already was super demanding that I get with him and that me having any sexual relationship before made me a slut and I need to date him and stop being like that. He was so angry at me and I felt bad and even was told that I cheated on him. 

So we got together, he was angry that I didn't do sexual things for him quite early on and that I've done it for others so I should love him and do it too. At a party we eventually did and he basically started biting my body (stomach and legs) and it started off not bad but it got harder and I said stop but he didn't and I had bruises for like 3 weeks. He did know my past btw but he said that he was helping me through it as long as I listen to him it would be okay. 

Basically after, he slowly made me doubt and not trust my friends, people at school and family (I was close to some, especially my younger brother who said he felt abandoned by me but I just felt that I couldn't be in contact anymore because my ex would critique everything he did until I didn't know who to trust.) I stopped being friends with my best friend of 5 years over little things that we would have sorted out if my ex wasn't involved. 

So my ex constantly said he was the only one who could help me with my ptsd which included getting me to do bdsm things to help ""overcome"" my fears? He then slapped me during sex once which meant that I couldn't stop crying and shaking. Also, he got me to be the ""dominant"" one once and I didn't like it. We broke up for a short period of time about 6 months later and at a meal with friends he told everyone I was the dominant one during sex and that became a rumour at school - I was so mad but he manipulated me to get back together. 

Also, he was jealous(?) of me in class I think because he constantly told me he was better than me, nobody works as hard as him, he can only spend time with me if he wants to based on his school work and made me feel bad for wanting to spend time with him (e.g. he would threaten to not talk for weeks if I said let's spend time together because I was ruining his grades but then when he wanted to spend time he would). I think grades came a bit more naturally to me and he would make me feel shit for that until I felt like I was awful at class. His friends joked whenever I spoke in class so he told me after that everyone thinks I'm stupid and annoying and I should stop talking. I felt upset because I have anxiety about talking in class but my teacher was really encouraging and I felt more and more confident at the time. Even when we went out for a meal, he was paying and I felt sick so didn't eat the rest and he started berating me like a child and I felt so rubbish. He even criticised every show/ music/ sport etc I enjoyed and made me change it. When I broke up I literally felt free to enjoy things I liked again but also upset that it was taken away from me.

Whenever I called him out on things he would tell me how much I'm a burden to him and how he is doing a favour by being with me and ""helping"" me and how dare I say that to him. I felt so frustrated that I argued back and got mad at times and he pushed me or got so in my face being aggressive a few times. My bother saw this once and said he wanted to punch him but I told him to leave. Also, I wasn't sure if I wanted kids (I was 16 so who has to decide then lol, also sexual abuse makes the idea scary to me) but he would constantly tell me that he wanted kids in the future and he would break up with me if I didn't do that. However, he also was paranoid about making me pregnant and made me take birth control (the pill and then the implant) when it made me feel horrible. I later found out that I have a condition (premenstrual-dysphoric-disorder) which is a hormone intolerance to the hormones found in birth control/ occurs the week before and during your period and it makes pms symptoms so much worse and drove me to feel suicidal and also made me feel crazy and upset and angry all the time. He refused to ""let"" me stop until I just did myself. 

In arguments when he was drunk he'd call me a bitch, whore, stupid etc. He also would constantly ""jokingly"" show me that he is stronger than me but actually it felt scary. He also would ""help me"" by doing things like trapping me under the bed sheets apart from my head and lying on top of me to help me ""cure"" my claustrophobia. I'd have a panic attack and try to get him off but he refused until I felt exhausted and gave in.  

During the 2nd year of dating, my parents became too hostile to live with so I lived at him with his mum and him but it was like it was the better of the 2 abusive places. He went to uni this year but was home a lot lot I went the year after. It all basically got worse and I think I became way more argumentative and would be mean back but honestly I felt like I was so trapped and going crazy and that was the only option. He started calling me abusive and I was mean at times but honestly sometimes it was just me calling him out or lashing out at how he treated me. This happened a lot and I felt suicidal the whole time and did try to overdose once. He also encouraged me to drink a lot with him (we were 18 but if you're not British - it's super normal in Britain to start drinking at 16 or even 14). But it all didn't help my ptsd and everyone else tried to stop me drinking which I have now but he just encouraged it and idk why because it was clearly so toxic (like me being sick every time and crying because of my ptsd). During these times he would get mad and be physically aggressive again, like pushing me to the floor and shouting in my face. He also constantly threatened to break up with me  if  I didn't agree with him and I felt dependant on him because I didn't know how to deal with my ptsd. He also would trigger my ptsd so much by asking ""moral dilemmas"" like if rapists should be allowed the be raped in prison(???) Then be mad when I said no or that I don't want to talk about it. Also what a stupid fucking question lmao. 

So it came to the point that I was going to uni and he had been there for a year. He was at Leeds uni and I wanted to go there too but missed my grades because I misread a question in one of the essays. Luckily I then actually ended up going to a different one (the one I actually liked rather than the one close to him still) and the summer before I left I felt like I was going crazy being trapped with him. I regret this and knoe that it's bad but I did cocaine with some boys when I was drunk and he wasn't there and ended up sleeping with one of them. It felt like the only way to break up because he wouldn't let me and I know it's wrong and hurtful and I regret it. He then made me stay with him and used it against me for months after and use it as an excuse to be abusive still. 

Then I went to uni and we broke up in and off again from September to January of my first year and each time he wouldn't let me have space or block him and I'd end up going back to him. He told me I made him suicidal and that made me stay as well. Eventually I did break up with him and have him fully blocked/ never spoke to him since. 

The whole time I felt like I was going crazy/ was an awful person who caused all this and I hated myself. Since I've managed to deal with my ptsd through therapy. I still do have anxiety and a fear of a new relationship because I'm terrified of being trapped and controlled. I also feel super upset that I am not friends with my best friend before and I'm trying to reach out a bit. I'm just still blaming myself a bit though and I only realised recently that I don't deserve this and it was abusive. Does anyone have any thoughts or advice. 

Thank you if you read ALL of that waffle haha. Xx"
"My ex and I have had a rocky and long relationship . But both coming from crazy ,dysfunctional families we ended up being really thankful for having found each other . Overtime the relationship went sour real fast and due to us I guess both subconsciously not wanting to go back to what it was like before &amp; whatever else ended up still staying / living together for quite some time . Haven’t lived together for over two years now but have still talked / made plans whatever . But every opportunity I feel like I give my ex that’s not just on a superficial level like watching a pet while away (for money) / letting them use my car . Something always has to happen . Two years ago (first time i went away and asked if they can keep an eye on my car ) of course had brand new tires they ran over a nail and instead of replacing the tire they got a patch over it and then of course I had to buy a new tire upon returning because the way the Nail hit my tire it was done for . Don’t know why they patched other than out of cheapness . Now I’m away for a little longer . At the halfway mark and they’re digging up things left from forever ago one thing being a spermicide . Accusing me of cheating and being dirty when it was literally the birth control we used &amp; is watching a pet and has now decided to block me until I return . I’ve also been asking everyday for pictures of my pet .I feel like every time I have tried to dead the relationship or cut ties . I always end up feeling guilty because I feel like I’ve given up / abandoned them (I have abandonment issues ) and then they’ll beg me to just talk a little bit or what not . I still have another week before returning I’m over a 1000 miles away so coming back before hand is kind of difficult . Why do I keep falling for this? How do I move past the hold I let this person have over me? Anytime there’s peace for more than a little something has to of course become a full blown war . Sorry I don’t have family to vent to and am upset . This person won’t answer me but I know regardless of when I return back to original town I’ll get an earful of how every downfall in our relationship is my fault  and after I leave and go back to my home with my pet they’re going to flood me with messages and calls of how our pets (who are siblings ) miss each other and I should pick up and what not .sorry had to vent / ask for advice of how to mentally get past it / anything will help"
"**Sorry, had to repost due to a typo in my title**

I'm (F21) a month into cutting contact after 4 years of talking to him (M23) basically every day. We were long distance the majority of the time (met online) but literally inseparable. He was truly my best friend. I've met lots of people, but he had a hold on me like no one else. I miss him so fucking much, at least who he was when he was sober. 

He wasn't a narcissist. He was just in so much pain. He suffered from mental illness and medication was barely working. I was the one that came into his life and made him feel accepted. The strong connection we had gave him hope. But this made him extremely co-dependent. He couldn't make friends, so I was truly all he had aside from family. Then he became an alcoholic when I decided to stay here for college instead of move in with him. 

A lot of emotional abuse went down as a result of the alcoholsim. He was incredibly destructive (i.e. drunk driving, causing a scene in public, calling me names, etc). I put up with it for 2 years until I finally pulled the plug. I was addicted to his highs and lows. I'd find myself completely forgetting our worst memories or being desensitized to them. We'd always end up talking like best friends, like nothing even happened.

But it got harder to do that. Last month he called me drunk and in the middle of nowhere. He told me he wanted me to be the last person he talks to. It took an hour of crying and begging to change his mind. I'm still traumatized from that night. I've lost two people to suicide in the past. I am so incredibly tired of losing people this way. My past losses are most likely linked to my ""saviour complex"" with this whole situation. 

Last I heard was that he was on the way to the mental hospital but I'm still not sure if he even got admitted. At this point, I'm not even sure if he's alive. And that is tearing me apart. All I want is to protect him from all his pain. I've been trying my best to put myself first and have been getting my life together. But regardless of how much better I've been doing, I'm crying almost every night. He's appearing in my dreams. I understand he's not my responsibility, but I am struggling so much to accept that I needed to leave. 

I've been talking to someone else throughout the year (my ex and I *technically* broke up last year) and they don't give me the same comfort. I keep comparing them and wanting the connection I once had. I've made it clear to them I don't even wanna think about relationships until I'm sorted but I don't even know how to sort myself. Good things have been happening. I've been accomplishing things like getting on the Dean's List at my uni and I just got my first job. I should be happy but I keep having moments where I feel so broken. I need help. Please, any advice is appreciated. 

How do you get over a trauma bond, especially when you don't feel like the abuser wasn't truly a bad person?"

"So I was in a relationship with a guy for ~4 years.  Met through friends and boy did he pounce hard. Always going to my place of choice even though he didn’t enjoy the drinks / food. Gifts by 3rd date, too much texting and hanging out late into the night. Being friendly with my group. 

~4 months later I was hooked and agreed to date exclusively (I usually take time to decide). 6 more months of excitement, trips and caring acts. And then snap, started the complaints - things I started changing a bit by bit such as hang out more often 3-4 times a week, eat his food of choice ordered down to a T, hang out more with his friends, not joining me in my plans, couple of more trips and then stop, would make excuse to travel too while ready with his friends. Drugs were involved, more recreationally then heavy usage. 

Then started the blame game - You don’t talk about this, you are always working, you do not suggest new things…one would get added to the list while I was working to improve on ‘prior’ points. Sometimes I was told our fights aren’t sorted and I use to wonder how because we had spoken and settled on changed. There were always issues he would find and I had no idea where they would come up from.

And finally break-up, I broke it off but couple of weeks later, started to beg my way back. Was told will talk later. I waited, texted, was spoken to like a stranger within a span of a month of the breakup. Did I tell you, we were talking marriage within the year before this. 

I went NC and he never came back. Posted about his new girl all over social media 6 months later. Never had done that with me. 

I moved places to be closer to him, gave up opportunities, my choice in plans and I was discarded like an old shirt. What happened here??!? I feel more free and have an idea of what happened but would like your views too. 

TL;DR - Was with a guy who showed that he was really into me but started changing 1 year into relationship. All the issues were highly confusing and sprang from nowhere. Even the break-up came with no closure."
"I’ve been dating my girlfriend over 2 years. She was abused in a previous relationship. I’ve helped her as much as I could and traumatized myself in the process hearing the stories. A couple months ago she started having scuiside thoughts. She finally got a therapist. Got two, one for scuiside one for abuse. The one about about her abuse is helping, the one about her scuisidal thoughts is not. All the weight is back onto me. I’m tired. I just want to lay here for one night and sleep. All I want is to be able to relax and sleep in peace without the worry she will kill herself while I am. I don’t want to leave her, in fact that would probably push her over the edge. I just want to be able to sleep. I don’t even know what I’m typing anymore."
""
Been looking on the web and cannot find any. Seems like Badass Army used to have one in the past. If you know of a support group let me know!
"I left my abuser and broke up with him by text (we cannot communicate on the phone so there was no way of getting my point across). As much as I know this was the right thing to do, I’m not going to lie, it hurts that he didn’t fight it at all, agreed, and hasn’t reached out at all. How can they be so loving and clingy and attached to you, and then slowly over time they discard you and treat you like you are nothing and want nothing to do with you? I’m so broken. He would gaslight me, try to control me in the beginning, and then about a year in he slowly started to discard me and refuse to give me attention when he used to be extremely clingy, then called me crazy, too clingy, and would stonewall me and not talk to me because I was begging for the bare minimum. I just don’t understand. I feel so worthless and thrown away."

I ask myself that daily.

My husband can be a very toxic person.

We was talking for a month before dating and I heard really bad rumours he was just playing me.
So I stupidly got drunk one night and had a one night stand and 10 years later, it's still an argument to this day. I think the 10 years of mental abuse and degrading me, belittling me, yelling in my face in front of our kids is worse than my small mistake.  I have apologized a million times, proved my worth to him, I bend my back backwards every day for him. I've done everything he has asked. I even deleted Facebook permanently, cut people out of my life who makes him uncomfortable.  I've told all my close chick friends the story and they think he needs counseling because he might have anger issues but understand both sides. He says I ruined him over this thing I did 10 years ago. Hes always depressed. And he can't look at me sometimes. Then he will start crying. I know what I didnt wasnt right and I feel terrible for all of it. I'm not saying I'm all right, and he is wrong, but I feel like the treatment I get is wrong.  Things will be great, and then he will flip a switch and say how hes depressed cause I couldn't keep my legs shut.  It feels so misleading thinking we are great. When he says we aren't. 
Then he will say things like ""when we fight,  we always have makeup sex, and you just give it to me. There's no fight. You dont make me fight for you.""

Wtf?? If I didn't have sex with you you'd get mad too. 

I'm a stay at home mom, I have major anxiety and I dont know how to drive nor do I have a job. So I do everything around the house. 

He works a good job. Hes the one with the income. 
It's hard to leave him because there is times where he treats me really good, and acts super sweet. We have everything in common besides the fact he's short tempered and I'm super sensitive.  We have created beautiful children together. We have a bond like no other.. sometimes..  I think we could be perfect for each other but I just think he's mentally abusive at the same time. 
I think it stems down that he  has a serious mental issue, either anger problems or bipolar. Because he can flip a switch in no time.  

Some other problems I have with him, is;

1. he expects me to do everything around the house since he works. He leaves his trash everywhere. So when I throw something away maybe on accident cause it looks like trash he will snap on me. 

2. He maybe the person with the money and buy the kids things but he doesn't want help with anything else. He won't ever change a diaper. Help me make a bottle. Let me nap, even since our 2nd was born, it was day 3 I was tired and I was sore from csection.  And hes like, you can take her with you while you nap. Yet he can nap all the time. Today he was sleeping and our 1yr started screaming while waking up and he woke up snapped on me for not calming her down. Yet he doesn't help but yelling at me. Whenever she starts to cry a little bit he gets snippy.  I asked him if he could watch our kids while I go out shopping  with my mom (I was gonna buy him birthday presents) and he snapped on me and said he doesn't wanna watch kids on his days off. And I was thinking ""so when will you ever watch YOUR kids?""  So I had to take at least our youngest with me. 

3. I broke my leg and it was day 2 and he snapped on me for not making dinner.

4. Whenever I say I'm tired and I've been walking around all day taking care of kids, cooking and cleaning, he has to one up me with saying hes more tired from work. 

5. Whenever he is mad, he will spout out anything to make me upset.  



It makes it hard for me to leave though because regardless of those bad things, he does some really great things that keeps me staying. 

Also having two kids really did a number on my body so I've been insecure about it, so I feel like if we broke up, no one would find me attractive.  But he makes me feel beautiful about that at least. I've been really trying hard to diet and work out to get into shape so I won't have that insecurity.

I want to leave him so bad some days, but then I start thinking about him with other girls and it makes me wanna cry. WHY IS IT SO HARD?"
"

I will keep this short and summarize to the best of my ability. The following is a gist, I suppose, of day to day interactions, verbal exchanges, or feelings. I am not a perfect person, but I have never been told I’m difficult to be in a relationship with. I feel like it’s the opposite and I may be being gaslighted and/or emotionally abused… I am not a naggy person, it takes a lot to piss me off, and as long as you’re not hurting yourself or others, I’m not really bothered by what you do or what you think. 


I almost feel like he’s been trying to change everything about me one by one since the day we met. First it was little things, I’m not allowed to fart in front of him or mention that I have to go ~poop~, I start to feel like I can’t eat in front of him anymore. Any bite I take is caught with an eye of disgust. I find myself right and it slowly escalates,  *Are you really going to eat more food right now?*, “Normal people don’t need an appetizer and dinner*. It gets worse, more…personal? *You’re so pretty….you just need to go to a gym.*, *Have you noticed we’re not having sex as much? Do you think your weight has anything to do with that?*. Things like repeatedly suggesting I keep a food diary, weigh myself every week, go to the gym daily. Simultaneously telling me how depressed I am, how nothing makes me happy, asking why I hate myself so much. To which my response is always “what the hell are you talking about?!”. Then I don’t have enough hobbies. I spend too much time doing nothing. I’m not going to the gym enough. I’m not losing weight fast enough. The friends I have aren’t good enough, they’re shitty people. He starts to give me “ultimatums”. Lose weight or we break up. “Put less food in your mouth” or we break up. Find more constructive things to do or we break up. I have begun to feel like nothing I ever do will be good enough. After I lose 20 pounds, the next thing is going to crop up and I’ll be getting another ultimatum, my self esteem is going to be torn down, whatever the hell else"
"He died May 28th. I was barely even starting to process the trauma of the sexual and emotional abuse, I told him if he didn’t change I would press charges…and he killed himself.

He isolated me from my family and friends. Sold my car. It happened so slowly and  after years and years I just reached a tipping point and realized how absolutely unlivable my life had become.  His family who had stood by and normalized the emotional abuse blames me. They learned about the rapes a month before, from him…so not the true extent of it. They feel my expressing a desire to press charges is what killed him. 

I’m here looking for resources. I have a lot to process."
"First time posting here so sorry if this isn't allowed. I'm 23 living with my mom and dad, all 3 of us bought a house together and I'm paying my share of the bills. I'm a bit of an introvert, don't know why just am, and prefer to stay in my room and play games or watch tv or whatever rather than go out to places. My dad was wondering why I didn't go down to the beach today since it was a beautiful day out and why I stayed inside all day, I gave him a generic response like I'm fine downstairs. After he left my mom asks me what she did wrong, I'm confused so I ask her what she means and she tells me that I don't have a life and that I have no friends. I just tell her I'm fine and go downstairs where I can be alone and cry. For years my mother has been saying things like I'm antisocial and that I have no friends I think it's gone on so long I just accept it now and think that's who I am. I guess part of this is just a rant and I'm not really sure if there's anything I can or should do to try and improve myself or my situation"

"People always say “call the police” “call the police” “call the police” and that’s what I did after 10 years of abuse. He was trying to kick me out of our apartment for the 3rd time. I told him if he locked me out again I’d call the police. This time I wasn’t bluffing. I had my pictures of all the past bruises and evidence I had ready to go. I told them I had proof of past abuse but they weren’t even acknowledging what I was saying. Instead they asked if we both lived there and both our names were on the lease. I said yes and they told him he couldn’t kick me out. My ex kept saying he had to leave to go work and when I said “it’s not a set schedule he’s an Uber driver” they said “oh well, that’s the money maker right now isn’t it” even though I had just lost my job. Before that I was paying half on everything. The cops said there wasn’t anything they could do and that they couldn’t kick anyone out. And then they left. That was it. The only helpful thing they did was tell him he couldn’t kick me out. I’m not trying to discourage people from calling the cops but it seems like unless it’s a physical altercation they could really not care less. I did find it funny how hard my ex was trying to get them to be on his side though. At one point he put his hand on the woman cops shoulder and she immediately pushed it off. Lol"
"I've been with my husband for 13 years. There were red flags in the beginning, but of course I ignored them. He has gradually gotten worse over the years, especially the last two years. I finally filed for divorce. He was served the papers on Friday when I was at work. I told him I would take the kids and stay with family for the weekend so he could think about things and cool off. Friday and Saturday he blew up my phone with texts with different threats. Today when I talked to him he sounded calm. So I said I would come over and discuss thongs as long as he remained calm. After about 10 minutes he started getting agitated, yelling and threatening me. I tried to leave he kept bloking the door. This went on for a while with him screaming in my face and me crying to let me leave. I finally got out the back door and went to the police department. He was arrested and now I feel terrible. I don't have a lot of family other than my kids. I just want someone to hug me and tell me I did the right thing."
"I moved out and left my boyfriend about 3 months ago and went no contact about a month ago.
I’m 38 and I feel isolated and would like to enjoy going out on fun dates. I don’t think I’m ready for a relationship, I would just like to enjoy my life. I still think a lot about my ex and find myself ruminating. I don’t want to waste anymore time thinking about pain. I don’t want to be with him at all. I just want to move forward.
This was my 3rd serious relationship in my life. When the other two relationships ended I stayed single for several years between them. I worked on myself during that time but sometimes I think I was just self isolating and depressed.  I feel like I’m going to be 40 before I know it. I don’t want my 30s to have been a lonely sob story!"
"I don't really know what to do or think... getting a therapist isnt an option right now and I just need to vent more than anything. I'm sorry if this is long.
I've been dating this guy for many years now and he has anger issues, which I could work with if he didn't take it out on me. Any minor annoyance or inconvenience is enough to send him into a temper ; slamming things, punching walls, yelling, insulting me, starting to argue and blame me. It's so bad I get anxiety whenever some little thing doesn't go right. 
With the help of friends I've been realizing the past couple months I'm being gaslighted. When I tell him how I feel or a problem we're having he immediately becomes defensive &amp; dismissive and somehow finds a way to turn it back on me. During these confrontations he raises his voice and gets in my face, and whenever i try to speak up or even talk about my side he continues to speak down to me. He wonders why I stay silent when it happens because it feels safer, and yet he also lectures me on staying silent too. My anxiety gets ramped up, I feel frozen and hurt, end up crying, and that's when it gets messy.
He hates crying. He said he's been raised to think it's weak, but I'm questioning that since one time his mother came in to console me and said I shouldnt apologize for crying. He calls me a crybaby and a 5-year old etc, and I tell him I don't like being called that but insists thats what I am. It takes a lot for me cry, but after years of this I can't help it and it feels shitty everytime I do. Recently he's called ME the abuser and it was so convincing I believed it.
I feel so worn out and anxious / sick. I often dream of just walking away and leaving but it's so incredibly hard and terrifying. There are times when it's great and we have fun together and the cycle starts again. Not to mention we've been together for so long and ""has never given up on me"". I wanted it to work but I'm realizing he won't listen or change. I'm tired of the lecturing, walking on eggshells, feeling annoying, rude snarky comments, scapegoating, ditching plans to please him... the list goes on."
"Hey, so as the title states, I am quite literally trapped. I need a way to get out of here and I am genuinely on my last straw of being able to handle this anymore. I live in America (Georgia, specifically) and I have hardly any money on me. I total at about $20 in debit card and $45 in cash. I need a place to go asap or a way to deal with this. I am going in for a job interview on Monday, but I don’t know if I will even get that job and I cannot find a way to escape being here. This post is probably scattered and doesn’t make much sense, but I need genuine help. I try really hard to keep a positive attitude about it all but it has been taking such a toll lately. My boyfriend’s family has offered for me to live with them, but they have to have a family meeting first and I’m not guaranteed to live there. I don’t know what to do as a backup if they say no. I just need some advice please.."
"Bit of background from previous posts: I left a six year relationship at the beginning of April. Since then I have been bouncing between my parents and brother's house while my ex stays in what was our apartment (mostly with her new SO from my understanding). Trying to put my life together the past few months has been absolutely awful and she has only made things worse. I'm still paying half the rent, but I managed to have her sign a release form to where the apartment is only in my name starting July 31st. She was supposed to be gone by the end of May, but here we are.

I checked last week to see when she was planning on moving out. I was hoping to move in this coming weekend instead of the end of the month. She told me she was getting her keys Saturday (now yesterday) and she would keep me updated. Since I was told this six days ago, I have had a terrible feeling in my gut that won't go away. That she is somehow, someway, going to find a way to hurt me still. That this is a stunt and she won't actually be moving until the end of the month and I will have to fight her on it. I'm shaking writing this out.

My thoughts have been in worse case scenario mode and that is all that has happened since leaving. It seems like everything that can go wrong, has gone wrong. I just want to be able to sleep in my own bed again, but am scared. For so long I felt like I was at a standstill for processing emotions and healing and that it was not being in my apartment that was the issue. That I just needed this to happen to start to feel better, but I don't feel ready. I'm scared that I'm going to get into my apartment, be alone, and that things will be worse. I've been in the apartment since the breakup to grab a few things, but not for an extended period of time. I've been having dreams this week about her. Dreams of us making up and having things go to how they used to be, then getting rejected all over again in the same dream. Dreams of not being able to see the dog we adopted because she won't let me. The dog that got me through so many of the bad parts of this relationship. The dog that I would do anything to get back.

I'm not ready to go through these emotions this week. I'm an absolute fucking mess and this might not even be over. It could still be some type of sick joke and I'll have to put up another fight, another argument, just to move back into somewhere that has some semblance of home."
"I apologize for the long wall of text. I just need to vent this all and get it out there somewhere. I just need a little support. 

I've (M 20's) been in two abusive relationships within the last 8 years that both lasted over a year. One was extremely physically abusive, manipulative, and mentally abusive. The other was incredibly mentally and emotionally abusive and manipulative. 

I have only just gotten out of the second one in October of 2020. Leaving incredibly damage, broken, hurt, and all around in a terrible place.

I have done a lot to recover and feel somewhat whole and okay again. The shame of having it happen to me twice is still there. The feeling that my friends and family do not take me serious as a male survivor is still there. I feel all around scared and anxious of new partners.

I've recently got involved with someone new. She's kind, patient, caring, understanding, empathetic, and Is okay with giving me space and days alone. She overall enjoys a lot of the things I love. She understands that I have trauma and that I still struggle sometimes. My issue here is that I'm still terrified. I am not entirely ready for another relationship yet, but she's a wonderful person with a wonderful personality. Unfortunately, things moved a little fast and I freaked out a bit and broke things off. (in a way that recognized that It's due to me needing more time to heal from the trauma. That it isnt the right time yet for me.). 

Being with someone intimately again triggered a lot of unresolved trauma and a lot of feelings I haven't fully dealth with yet. I did not want to hurt her by having an unhealthy relationship while I'm dealing with trauma. 

I feel horrible in so many ways. I feel ashamed that I cant toughen up and finally let myself have a healthy relationship. I feel ashamed for getting scared when I'm alone with her  even though she didnt do anything. I feel terrible for not expressing that I need things to go slow from the beginning. I feel terrible because I feel I am still letting my past abusive relationships control me and im letting them win. I feel horrible for now having commitment issues and intimacy issues because I want to run away from people. I dont want to hurt her in anyway by not being healed.

I truly want this to work, but the timing isnt right. I need more time to heal. I need some time alone and independent from someone else to allow myself to be whole again. I just feel so horrible because I wanted this to work and to finally be with someone who won't abuse me and take every part of me. Someone who wouldn't take advantage of my care taker personality type. 

 I do believe putting things on pause and breaking up is the right call. Until I figure out and heal from the trauma im dealing with, I shouldn't recklessly involve myself with someone like that. Especially someone who I don't want to hurt.

The part that truly sucks is this weird limbo where I know we both want to be with the other person, but it isnt the right time you know? How do you pretend that you arent feeling that way and talk like things are normal. I very much want to be friends, but I recognize that it's a selfish desire right now. I can't like keep her around until im ready. She's a human being with thoughts and emotions too. This isnt all about me.

I just want to find the right way to truly tell her that I need time, but I dont want her to wait for me. Does that make sense? She is willing to give me the time until im ready, but I dont want to string her along for weeks/months/years until ive decided in ready for something serious.  

Why can't I just let something good happen and let the right person in? Why do I have to be hurting and be so scared? Why can't I just calm down? It just all hurts so much in a way I cant describe. The last thing I want to do is possibly hurt someone or use someone to heal me. I do not want to be selfish and use someone as a dumping pit for my trauma. They deserve better than that. This all just hurts and feels terrible. If anyone actually read all of this then thank you for hearing me.

Tldr; Trauma from past relationships making it incredibly difficult to move onto a new healthy relationship with a new person."
"After months of abuse, mostly emotional, I'm on the brink of a nervous breakdown I'm sure. Now when we fight I scream &amp; cry uncontrollably and I don't even really know why. I want to rip my hair out and rip my skin off. I used to cut myself to ease the pain but I have so many scars on my legs I don't want to keep doing that. It's so hard to resist it though when I feel I've lost control of everything. When I've been abused, put down, belittled, badgered, outcast, and now that I'm snapping I'm the narcissist. We made up but come back to still being treated badly because I wasn't ready to eat right then. I don't know what to do anymore. I feel my mental health is so bad that I'm not able to even do much. I just want to make myself not feel and be upset at my world crashing down. I get soooooo tired of being told I'm wrong and I'm the bad one for calling him out on his unacceptable behavior. I guess just let him do and say whatever  and not worry about it? How do I do that though. It's near impossible for me not to say or do anything about how he is making me feel. Because I'm constantly letting him know what's not acceptable and how he makes me feel like shit, I'm killing him. He isn't himself anymore and can barely work. Why??? Cause I tell you I'm tired of being shunned and treated badly for nothing.. I need help and I don't even know what kind of help. I just want out. 😭😭😭"
"I feel SO alone. So angry I wasted so much time on this loser who never even wanted me, just used me for every little thing he could. I feel so behind. Am I even going to get to experience any of these things?! I don’t feel like I have enough time to meet someone and build a whole relationship before I’m too old. Tell me I’m not the only one who feels this way please."

"I didn’t realize it until today, my fiancé (M26) has always jokingly called me names, but today it drew the line, he simple asked a question to which i was confused about and asked and he straight up called me a an idiot for not knowing. This might not be much but he’s always dumb shaming me, and calling me fat, big, and other things. I’ve told him to stop and how i don’t ever do that to him and he has promised to stop and try the name calling but goes back to it the next day and uses the “sorry it’s hard not to call you names” excuse. Am i over thinking this?"
"I was in a crazy abusive relationship for the past two years. Marriage, extreme physical abuse, manipulation, verbal abuse, pregnancy, a miscarriage, constant cheating from him, isolation, him destroying everything I own, attempted suicides on both sides, the whole nine yards. But somehow I thought he was the most loving person I’d ever met. I opened up to him about massive reoccurring traumas that had previously been blocked out of my memory and he convinced me everything bad I’d ever been through was my own fault. And if I didn’t share every detail of my life before him I was a manipulative liar. He taught me to fear myself and the world, that he was my safe place. But in reality I was in more danger than ever being with him. But somehow he’d always convince me that he saw his flaws and downfalls and he was devastated by them and he was ready to change, and that I couldn’t leave right as he was finally getting it.
Then he’d snap again.
He did so many things I thought he would never do, and I will always have to live with the consequences of trusting him to the degree that I did. Three weeks ago, he moved in with family 6 hours away driving. He didn’t want to leave, he cried a lot. He denied what was happening for weeks until he finally left. But he was kind and calm through it all as he started taking medication about 2 months ago. Three days ago, I cut off contact with him. We would still text scarcely since he’d left. He was understanding and he has not reach out to me since. Currently I live in the house we moved in together when we got married and the physical abuse started. Ever since I cut off contact with him I’ve been in an ongoing state of panic. I fear he will show up at my house and break in while I’m not home, or that he will show up at my car in the lot across from my work when I’m going home. I want to believe I am safe now that he’s gone but the truth is that I have underestimated him far too many times and it has severely harmed my physical &amp; mental health as a result. So I finally started telling people the truth of what I went through. I told my manager at work yesterday, and he was incredibly kind and supportive. I’m a female cook at a restaurant with mostly guys, and they are very caring and genuine people. A lot of my coworkers have seen him come into the restaurant as well, so I felt I should let them know that way they can all watch out for me. I’ve also been more open with a couple friends outside of work (the only two friends I have left) and my therapist.  But ever since I started telling the truth about my story, I feel I am betraying him. I know his story and I always had so much understanding and compassion for him that it kept me in a very dangerous place. Ever since I cut off contact with him I feel I don’t know what to expect. My anxiety is going crazy through the roof, I started panicking wondering why I even told my work at all even though I know it was the smart thing to do.. I’ve been strongly encouraged to move out of this house immediately, buy a taser, and get a restraining order. I’m working towards those steps which is also why I addressed it with my manager, to ensure consistent scheduling and income. But when I start thinking about it I get sent into a panic. I’ve barely been eating at all the past few days. I start to think I’m completely overreacting and attention seeking. And I get scared that if he found out I was being open about it that he would become angry and retaliate somehow… it feels like I’d be better off not telling anyone and just trying to keep things cool between him and I like I always would before."
"So I broke up with my narcissist partner ( they are non binary) 4 months ago . We have never gone full non contact for long . For a bit we were trying to try again but that fell through . 
I was in horrible shape for a few months and I worked on self care . I basically did a lot of the stuff I wanted them to do during our relationship. ( therapy , medication , self care) 
They had told me they were doing this stuff also and in a good place . 
 I have been in a real good place for almost a month so I reached out to them to tell them I am doing really good . 

 They said they were happy for me but they aren’t doing so well . I asked because I care and they said they stopped eating and were in the ER for malnutrition. I told them I was worried about them and such . 

 Then the next day they messaged and told me a few weeks ago they attempted suicide . 

 They already are engaged to someone else .  I stopped looking at their social media months ago but it was always how great they were doing , mine was honest that I wasn’t .. 
everyone in my orbit is saying they are lying, but why ? 

I always am honest with them that I love and care for them . 
My best friend said because I didn’t rush to them with the first bad thing they upped the bad thing again . 
But that makes no sense , if they wanted to see me just say “I want to see you “ and I would go . 
It’s like they need to manipulate me to do things I would freely give ?"
"Long story short my boyfriend has mental issues, does drugs now for the last 5 years, he used to be okay, but now he's become very mean, hurtful, angry, violent verbally/emotionally/physically, he's always gaslighting me and making me feel crazy, he'll blame everything he can on me, makes any bad in his life my issue and my fault and gets angry at me always, calls me constant names, ugly, whore, fat, hoe, skank, too many names to list.. He even gets angry at me when I don't accept him calling me pretty or beautiful.. I just don't believe it anymore when I've been told enough how far and ugly and loose I am.. that's another thing he believes in always cheating on him, to the point he's told me I fucked the whole city and has threatened me to ""stop acting like a little whore and fucking everyone"" and he wouldn't treat me that way, but the thing is.. he's so possessive, I can't even do things like use the bathroom without him being right there, we are literally together 24/7 I work from home too, so I get no time to myself, yet he has the audacity to tell me I'm messing around on him. This is where his new found mental issue comes in, he will tell me it's because I sneak off and have another girl come in my place that looks like so I can go have sex and calls me a freak because he believes I do this.. I've told him before this is all too much and I wanted to leave him and he'll get angry and threaten me and say the real me (because remember he thinks other girls take my place) wouldn't ever leave him.. I'm at a loss of what to do.. I love him and I also feel like I don't anymore.."

"Ranting. So I don't know if my belief in God is toxic or not it's quite confusing.

I met my fiance right when I was losing grip on reality, I was gonna try and move across state to get away from my child's father because he was abusive, even though him and I weren't together, he would use our daughter against me so I wanted to just get away.

My friend needed a roommate. She lied about the house. There was one tiny room, and her roommate was a fifty year old alcoholic perv. I'm sober. I don't wanna live w people who drink let alone a perv when I have a daughter, plus my daughter needed her own room tf?

I was ready to leave my own two bedroom apartment though! I was alone everyday and it was driving me nuts. And so was my daughter's dad even though we were separated, he would come inside my apartment when picking up our daughter or give me money, and there was no healthy boundary there. I wanted an escape. I was borderline psychosis as well at this point.

But then, my fiance started talking to me. He told me he would help me clean my apartment up and hang out with me so I wasn't alone. My fiance seemed to make me so much more stable. We cleaned my place. I left my friends before losing my place thank God.

 I got a job which I've held. Medicine worked awesomely. The voices stopped (I'm diagnosed schizo affective). I've been able to keep the house cleaner than ever. Didn't need to move to get away from my child's father and he's not bothered me since. He used to bother me when I'd ask him to help babysit but now we have a legal custody agreement. Anyway my fiance was like literally I'm telling you, right on time. If it weren't for him I'd have lost my current place and never been able to move out of my friends place cause I have bad credit and a previous eviction which I found out recently. Basically if I didn't meet my fiance I'd have been so fucked mentally, financially, and physically. No doubt. I was losing it. Couldn't even watch television cause of psychotic symptoms. 

Once I met my fiance we could binge watch television and my symptoms didn't show. I got on a medication to help when he wasn't with me. But once he moved in I didn't even need it anymore, plus, I got pregnant and the pregnancy is keeping me even more stable. Some women w my mental issues are more stable while pregnant I'm one of them.

So, Then the nightmare began. Fiance's abusive, just as my child's father was. Threatening to harm me has put bruises on me.. already etc.

Like. How? How the fuck? Why? I'm pregnant and this was such a huge ''blessing''. Or is this just human nature..? My last relationship did nothing to help my psychosis. Why did this particular man basically fix me just to turn around and be a nightmare. What a turn of fucking events. Fuck.

He did get on steroids. But I think his behavior is just built into him. He gets triggered and uses abuse to regain control. Other days he was an angel.

Is it just a coincidence I've gotten so much healthier? A shitty miracle, the best God could do for me at this time?

Then I think of the women's whos boyfriends actually kill them and wonder if this has shit to do with God at all.

Like did God take this risk to save me from another or pure coincidence? Now he's in jail so I'm safe. So many don't make it out alive.

I still have my mental health. I still have my money saved. I still have everything I've learned from this but I'm just like if we weren't meant to be then why?

I need some more words of wisdom and encouragement to move on from this because I keep telling myself God sent me him right on time but that doesn't mean I stay with him.  

I spent this whole year planning our life together but it's like dangerous at this point. I know some have to leave when they're already married.. I know some who never leave but I have a chance to finally end it.

My cousin put it this way, when you graduate school do you go back and do it again? No take what you learn and keep moving up.

It's so hard. The physical attachment. Being abused, feeling trapped. I would have stayed with him forever. Why did it seem so picture perfect?

TLDR: my fiance saved me from messing up and losing everything, my mental health is better than ever cause of him, but it turns out he's abusive and dangerous. I'm looking for some kind of understanding and wisdom to be able to move on. I guess some people do get stronger after trauma sometimes and it's finally my chance to do that?"
"At the time, I (27f) did not understand that I was being emotionally abused by my now ex gf (30f). 

I'm not sure if it was denial or simply a lack of education on what emotional abuse is, but I stayed in the relationship for multiple years, and while now I am three years out and much healthier and safer, I feel the abuse belittled me to an extent that I don't know how to be myself in romantic relationships. 

Before the relationship, I was independent, outspoken assured of my wants/needs and unafraid. Now, I make myself small, underplay my needs and worry about causing friction for fear that my new partner or date will leave me.

Thankfully, I am getting better! I have a great therapist who has really helped me and I have a vast/active support system. I guess, that being said, I'm in a place now where I understand that these changes are because I was abused, and for me to feel safe with a new partner, I need them to know that. I'm not dating rn, but am curious as to how you as survivors shared you were abused with a new partner. How did you know it was the right time to tell them? And what language did you use? What are green flags that indicate they are a safe person to share this with?

"We had been together for almost a year and a half and were long distance. He was controlling, gaslighted me, stonewalled me, amongst many other things. I have an anxious attachment style and he would use that to ruin me. I would bring up something that hurt me and he would become livid, hang up on me, and shut me out for days at a time. He made me feel worthless. Absolutely worthless. He would degrade me, call me crazy, threaten to ghost and block me (which I had told him many times really triggered me due to my anxious attachment), but he never cared. He is one of the most selfish, cruel people I have ever met. Yesterday I lost my shit on the phone because I was literally BEGGING this man to spend time with me. He has been shutting me out for days on end (discarding?) He told me all’s he wanted to do was play video games. I said again, please spend time with me, it makes me feel unloved because I’ve been shut out for days for no good reason and he flipped, so then I did. I’ve had enough. I sent him a long message (not as harsh as I wanted to send, I felt I was pretty nice), blocked him from social media, and that’s it. I’m really hurting and I’m terrified I’m going to give in. This person has hurt me so deeply and done very messed up things to me, but I still feel guilty. How did you guys that left deal with the guilt but stay strong? I could use all the support I can get. 
Thanks so much."
"I kicked my abuser out a few days ago. I told him that once he went to treatment then we can discuss our future. He said he respected my choice and was proud of me for making this choice. This response really left me dumbfounded. Fast forward to tonight, he is calling me and accusing me of sleeping with people now that he is gone. He is trying to make me feel bad for “making him homeless” even though he is not. He has done and said his normal script of name calling, accusations, lying and manipulating. Then he finishes the conversation off with Im not giving up on you, this was your choice and Im proud of you. 

Im so confused. I need help navigating this. What is this behavior?"
"My wife and I have been married for around 6 years and at first things were great but over the past few years, I have felt myself getting more and more isolated, not being allowed to go out, questioned if I spend too long getting home after work, things like that, and recently, she has encouraged me to get a job working from home and it's gotten to the point that, I feel I don't have friends outside of her friends and family.

My family and I have had a strained relationship in the past due to anger issues I had as a young adult, and if I want to spend time with them, or take our daughter down to see them, I am met with instant warnings about how much my strained relationship with them is because of how they treat me, and that they are just going to upset me all over again so I shouldn't bother.

If we argue, my wife will always get to a point where she tells me that I'm getting aggressive and due to my anger issues when I was younger, and my parents anger and self control issues, I always stop whatever we are talking about as I feel like I want to control my temper.

When having our daughter 2 years ago, my wife went through a lot of trauma with the after labour healing and since then she has told me we can't have sex anymore and if I try to speak to her, she cuts me off or tells me I'm being too pressuring her.

I have always had issues with my appearance and this is one of things my wife and I bonded over, but now if I try to improve myself, I am told it's pointless because I'm too big or too lazy or eat too much and it isn't going to work.

I'm getting to breaking point but know that if I leave, I can't survive on my own financially and will fail and have to go home to my family, who live far enough away to lose out on time with my daughter.

I don't know what to do anymore."
I can’t stop thinking about it. It’s killing me so bad. I just want to stop thinking about her.
"I've known my husband is abusive for a while now, but for a long time, I didn't. 


A mix of wishful thinking, denial and trying my best to ignore it - to not even think the thought.


It hit me recently that what made me realise it and be honest with myself, was the smallest thing compared to the rest.


Something other people might be able to ignore and not even think about...


He never ever EVER cares about keeping anything tidy. Not even when I have begged and cried and pleaded with him to do so.


I'm so so tired of and just done with being the only one to do any cleaning and all other household chores. I also work and go to school, so keeping a set of systems in the closet and cupboards and trash bins is the only way I can do it all. 


Yet he could not care less about leaving them a complete mess every day, not giving a second thought or a single fuck to how much time and effort it takes me to constantly fix it.


Yet he'll get mad and yell and make me feel like crap if it's not perfect by the time he opens it up again.


It made me realise that it's not that he doesn't care about keeping things clean and tidy; he doesn't care about me. He doesn't care about my well being, or my time. He sees himself as above it; above me.


It takes no effort to throw a crisp bag in the bin instead of leaving it in the sink. 


It's not hard to fold the shirts he pulled out, looking for his favourite, and put them back, instead of leaving them all over the floor.


It's so easy to remember to just put whatever he used in the kitchen in the dishwasher, and not leave me a sticky mess of cutlery and leftovers to clean off the counter when I get home. 


At a certain point, it's no longer just being lazy or forgetful, it's straight up being mean on purpose."
"1. He's a police officer (I'm sure I don't need to explain more on that)
2. I'm disabled and isolated from any support system
3. Ironically the biggest barrier: I'm still in love with him despite how he hurts me. That emotional bond and deep dependency that developed over the years we have been together is not something I have rational control over - I can't just turn off my feelings and move on. I've tried. My entire nervous system is connected to this person on a subconscious level. Being apart from him makes me want to die, as he has become like a caretaker. I know logically that I'm being mistreated but that doesn't change the strength of my attachment to him."
"For the first time in a long time I’m really missing him. Sure, he told me I was the narcissist, that I was too sensitive, that I was incompetent, that he regretted ever meeting up with me again after high school, that I was too fat to love, etc., but I still love him anyways. There’s a part of me that really misses him and agrees with him even though I did nothing wrong. 

Why doesn’t the love stop even though he told me all those horrible things? Why can’t I internalize them and feel the hurt from them and detach?

I feel like two people- the bitter, jaded girl who is angry at him for being so cruel and who hates the world, and then on the other hand, the loving, kind, person who still loves him and wants to be with him even though he was so mean to me."
"“Maybe you should smile at your wife” 

“Maybe you should fuck you wife” 

Why the fuck would I want to smile at a woman who has taken everything I do and say, and used it all against me? Every personal thing I’ve ever told her, everything I do, all I say. I can’t fucking walk into the kitchen or house without having to stop what I’m doing to give her a hug that she demands of me, but then she won’t even ask how I am..and she’ll go on and on about herself. 

I don’t enjoy having my exits blocked, called names, having things thrown at me, doors slammed in my face, yelled at an inch from my face like she’s a drill sergeant. Fuck this. Fuck all of this. I am done being depressed everyday, suicidal. Im done being numb."
"I have a lot of thoughts about it that im not that comfortable with posting, but I  need someone to talk to if possible, I havent been sleeping, eating or functioning well since she left me, even if she generally treated me like dirt and with little significance the past 2 months, Im having doubts with myself and my trust is gone."
"I’ve been in a rocky relationship for the past year that just ended recently. Several months back my ex pulled a knife out on me in a fit of rage and threatened to slash my car tires whilst banging on the spare bedroom door that I was behind. We tried to make things work after this event for whatever reason but now unfortunately she is coming to the martial arts gym that I teach out of and has refused to stop coming to the gym maybe in hopes of making me uncomfortable. 

Would it be too late or impossible to get a restraining order against her?
I also have video of her with the knife as she screamed she was going to slash my tires. The same video shows her banging as hard as she could on the door that I was behind, enough so to take chunks out of to door in which it was removed entirely the next day.
I need help to rid this person of my life."
"Hi guys. I'm 3 years out of a 2 year abusive relationship. I just had another nightmare after he had found a way to contact me, which freaked me out because I thought I had blocked him on everything. So, naturally, I lurked around this sub for a bit and found some posts about reactive abuse. 

When I was in this relationship, there was a point where I got so angry I hit him back. This was around the time I was trying to get out. I called the domestic abuse hotline at some point, just to talk to someone about what was going on because I felt so lost, and I mentioned this. I was freaked out at myself. He kept telling me I was the abusive one, and I believed him. I was told by the domestic abuse prevention hotline that we both had some anger that we needed to work on. 

Thinking back to that, I didn't realize at the time, but I am so angry I was told this."
"My brother Sam has been dating his bf  Alex for around 5 years. Alex has always been incredibly selfish and demanding, but he seems to be causing Sam's life to completely unravel and I'm more worried every day. Things that have worried me include:

- Alex insisted that they had to move to the other side of the world, and Sam went along with it even though he had no interest in moving there and it meant losing his job and leaving his friends and family. Alex picked that place because his druggie friend lives there, but now they have fallen out he's insisting that they move to another random country.
- Alex makes terrible choices that put Sam in danger eg. Sam fell and hit his head badly, asked for someone to call an ambulance, but instead Alex and his friends tried to pressure him into getting high. This is one of many examples.
- Alex doesn't work and is funded by his parents. Sam works full time and pays most of the bills. Alex makes Sam drive him to the shops and other random excursions and if Sam can't because of a work meeting or job interview, it will cause a huge fight and Alex claims that he's ""sacrificed everything"" for Sam's career. Sam has missed job interviews to drive Alex to the shop.
- Alex tries to break Sam's self esteem, eg. he recently told Sam ""the sight of you hunched over your work laptop makes me sick. I can't think of anyone who inspires me less.""
- Sam told me he currently works until midnight every night because so much of the working day is taken up by driving Alex about or doing stuff for him. Alex has expensive tastes that somehow Sam ends up funding. Sam has run out of money and is borrowing from my parents.

I need to help Sam! He was very bullied as a child and I think it's made him susceptible to being exploited. Alex has borderline personality disorder and a tough background (mother in prison, father wealthy through organised crime). Sam wants to stay with Alex.

I've told Sam that I'm concerned but that I will support him no matter what, and that I think Sam should work on asserting boundaries. Sam is open to anything that will help him manage Alex better, but not to leaving.

What resources can I send Sam to help him break out of his codependency? He's a smart, attractive, kind and gentle guy who has had all of his self esteem bullied out of him.

Thank you so much in advance!

Tldr: what resources could help my brother to assert his boundaries and stop his bf trampling all over him and destroying his life?"
"So… yeah. It was the last straw now.

I’m a foreigner who’s living in Portugal with my soon to be then-Portuguese wife. 

Long story short, my wife (who is not a wife, apparently, and, is now accusing me of putting transsexuality into their head) has abused me in every way and has  me up for so many times. I’ve had it this January 2021. I asked for a divorce. Then she beat me up. Lied to the police that it was all me. Then I took her back (it’s okay, you can laugh). Then another beating happened. February 13, 2021. The night before valentines. Beat me up again because we were having a discussion. Police took her. Found out later she lied to the police again. Okay. This time I won’t take her back. Nope. I went to her city to help her with the legal repercussions of lying to the police. Then, boom. In love again. After many hearings, fees and legal action, we got it to be a suspended sentence (she has been charged with domestic abuse and lying to the police). 


She (or he IDK) came out as trans. Cut off the family.

Two weeks ago, she had a verbal explosion and a physical one (not with me, with objects. Keep in mind that I’ve seen this happen before). Nightmares and hypervigilance started. 

Today, didn’t wake up in a very good mood. Was lazy. She started calling me disgusting, putting middle fingers up my face, calling me a whore. I was done. I started packing. She said “are you sure of this decision?” I said I was. She stared hitting me, kicking my face, punching my eyes, slamming a guitar in my head.


Called the police. They sent me to a hospital.


Now the family is threatening me to go to court for “forcing her to cut off ties and forcing her to be a transsexual”. 

Again, lying to the police about what happened.

Now, with the suspended sentences, I honestly don’t care what the police are gonna do with him/her.

I just need to protect myself in this country. I’m alone here and can barely understand Portuguese.


Getting my legal help in line. 

God, I’m so done."
"I'm [m24] and my ex [f25] suffered from various diagnosed mental illnesses which caused her to lash out to any of her friends and me whenever she was having a tough time. She's given me multiple black eyes, multiple concussions , coerced me into being intimate with her way more than I could physically,  otherwise she'd see other guys, she consistently poured hot coffee on me, destroyed the interior of my car, punched multiple holes in the walls of my place , stolen bunch of money,  knowingly gave me herpes and didn't tell me she had it because she didn't want me to leave her,  let  me know constantly how worthless and stupid and ugly I am on a daily basis and how It's my fault she did any of that. When I went and had a brain tumor removed , she couldn't help but tell me how pathetic I am and worthless I am that I'm not able to be self sufficient . During the recovery, she ended up just flying to her home state to see friends, go to raves , and have fun with guys she's ""missed out on."" I understand completely it doesn't make any sense why I can't stop missing her. I know it's toxic . I know it's harmful to have her in my life but Idk. How do you get over this ? I tried everything to make her feel loved. Paid both of our rents , moved her to California like she wanted, bought her phones, anything on her wishlist,  paid for all her utilities or literally anyrhing. When we worked at the sam job, if she had a mental breakdown , is make sure to pull double shifts so she could have a day. I don't know. I just feel like I'm not good enough now and I feel like I don't know how to get over this. How do I do it? Please help"
"We have been together on-off for three years. He was the one who always left and then came back. I loved him and wanted to accept him every time. I tolerated his insulting ""jokes"", cruel comments, his breaking up with me because of funny and petty reasons and then coming back to say that he wanted to marry me and he loved me etc. I believed him. He didn't let me question him saying that I should stop thinking about past and shouldn't behave and talk and question him as if he was my enemy. He told me that he had been doing everything to show me how he changed and I didn't appreciate him, while he was changing I was still the same. He wanted me to believe him no matter what without questioning.

Then I asked him why he was so close to this new female friend and was speaking to her constantly. Even though she had a boyfriend we met all once and I knew when they were going to meet one on one  and even though I was her private teacher (my ex wanted me to do that and I happily accepted it first trusting him). But she was being too involved in our daily lives and after he became like he didn't see me, I got more suspicious and my gut was screaming at me to be cautious. I had just wanted him to put some distance between them as their closeness was making me uncomfortable. It wasn't like they were childhood friends, they have been close only this uear and I only met her 3 months ago. 

After I wanted him to put distance, he became really angry and told me he had never heard such a thing before (he was the one who had questioned and condemned me in the past because I wasn't a virgin) and then I broke up with him because he in any way accepted to do that and then as soon as we broke up he blocked me. 

I just don't know why I was so naive, so stupid enough to let a man treat me like trash and then discard me as if I was nothing to him. I can't get over it. I just hate him. Some nights I can't sleep because I feel nauseous and want to throw up. I can't stop thinking about all those days they met at his home alone. I can't stop thinking how he could also do this to me. I feel I was cheated on. I can't prove it but I can make sense of his overreaction. 

I was first sorry to blame her and then when I thought about it she was also just making some comments that had been making me uncomfortable and she didn't even pay me for my private tutoring and helping her after our break up. I feel so insulted. Sometimes I check their socials and they are still friends there and they act like nothing happened at all. I just feel a burning feeling in my heart. I don't know how I will heal and trust another man once again."

"We've been together for 13 years and have an 8 year old together. I've come to the realization over the last year and a half that he is indeed, emotionally/mentally abusive with covert NPD tendencies and uses coercive control over me. I love him but I seriously need to think about leaving for the good of my mental health and more importantly, our child's. 

How do you leave when you have a child together?

What do I say to our child?

How do I stop caring SO much about how he will survive after I leave our home? He doesn't have a job.. how will be pay bills? Mortgage? Do I continue to pay it while he gets on his feet?? 

How do I stop thinking about the good he's done and second guessing myself when I know the bad outweighs the good? I'll see the things I know are bad but find myself thinking back to when he seemed to be trying and caring and loving and stop thinking about the bad and think that he is that good person but it's my fault for turning him into the bad one. 

I know that I can't leave completely or go no-contact because we have a child together and that just wouldn't be fair to either of them. 

I'm so confused and lost."
"I’m about 1.5 months post-breakup and I’m doing a better day-to-day, but I can’t stop having dreams (and often nightmares) about my abusive ex-boyfriend. Often in the dreams it’ll just be a sort of normal day as if the breakup never happened, and then in the dream I’ll think, “No, I don’t want to go through this again. Why did I let him come back again?” And then I’ll wake up and immediately feel relieved that he isn’t in bed next to me. Other times, I’ll be having a normal dream and he’ll just sort of be there. Still other times, I try to break up with him or stand up to him in the dreams, and he becomes violent.

Have any of you experienced this? Did you find a way to get the dreams to stop? Do they ever go away? I’ve been having them most nights and it’s been draining."
"I’ve been with my bf for about seven months now. I was in a bad long term relationship before this. 

My current bf is the best. He’s funny and quirky and so kind to me. The problem is I’m not used to someone saying nice things to me. He will compliment me about my looks or really anything and my initial reaction is to be skeptical. I’ll squint my eyes, roll my eyes, I’ve told him that I think he’s lying about having those nice thoughts about me. When we are in bed I’m convinced that he’s having a terrible time, even though he always expresses enjoying himself. I frequently will think that he’s mad at me. 

He has been saying that it seems like whatever he says I take the opposite way.

I know it’s wearing on him and I don’t want to mess this up. 

Any advice would be appreciated."
"I can’t take anymore hurt and viscousness in my life! I no longer know who I am anymore and I’ve become this empty shell. I am even alien to myself and that is scary!!! I have been a part of a nasty toxic relationship with a man who has fucked up my life beyond anything I have ever comprehended. Now I know  what you’re thinking, yes I’ve have made my own choices in life, however I recently realized this man that I may still love has access to everything on my dang phone. So not only did this man beat the shit out of me, took my kids, kept them from me for 7 Fucking months and broke our mother/son bond, then over took my phone and has all the info I have by a remote hacking app. 

Whatever is supposed to be of a person, was completely stripped of me. I have no privacy I have no security I have nothing left to even resemble a human being!  I am nothing!!!! There is nothing left of me. I’ve tried to hang in there and I just can’t anymore! I was supposed to kill myself today. Obviously haven’t done it yet😂😂😂 SORRY, I have a fucked up sense of humor I’M SORRY


There’s more to the story, i have been an addict for over 25 miserable years! I can’t stand my own self! I was actually clean while arriving in my new state. Well until my weed was laced with fentanyl… sooo here we go again! I basically just want people to know the way you treat someone could mean last breath! See it’s hard for me to realize that people are sick and twisted in their mind actually exist in the world today and are overtaking people like me who are decent and kind people"

"So I’m feeling incredibly lost about my relationship and decided to post here and ask for help. 

My (22M) girlfriend (20F) has been treating me horribly for some considerable time now. The relationship has nearly all possible characteristics of an abusive one. Whenever we have a small disagreement, she will call me names, insult me, my intelligence and my masculinity and generally the very essence of my being. She can also be extremely controlling and doesn’t react well when I go out or meet with anyone without her which has resulted in me giving up on most of my social life. She also never takes responsibility for her actions (she always has an excuse for her rudeness)

The reason why I’m trying to tolerate all of this is because around 2 months into the relationship I cheated on her by kissing a close friend of mine on a party. I realize completely that this behavior is disgusting and there’s no excuse for it and I regret it deeply. I confessed this immediately and my girlfriend decided to take me back. Since that time she’s always using this as an excuse for being rude to me or control me. 
In the beginning I didn’t have a problem about this, because I felt like I deserve the control and rudeness because I hurt her, but this happened almost almost 2 years ago, and there’s no sign of change on her side. 

I also saw some red flags in the  beginning of the relationship (some small blows to my self esteem, her describing herself as “manipulative”, constant bitching about her ex boyfriends, and bragging about “taking revenge on them”), but on the other hand she can be an extremely loving and caring person in the good moments - she also tells me many nice things, and always says how she’d like to stay with me forever, so I’m literally torn and don’t know what I’m dealing with. 

Is she an abusive narcissistic, or just a hurt girl who needs more time to heal? 

Thank you for reading this long-ass post, and sorry for any language errors - English is not my first language :)

"Long story short, my ex (M23) and I broke up in the end because he strangled me in a drunken rage when I took his keys from him to prevent him from driving. He threw me around and verbally degraded me for hours before pinning me down and strangling me. I managed to call my mom, who showed up just in time to witness him throwing my into a glass table. I contacted the police the next day and went through that entire process, including the hospital exam. He was prosecuted and pled to a lesser charge, and sat a mere 5 days in jail. 

The tricky thing is we have a lot of heavy history…like, been in the psych ward together heavy, and I love him deeply. He was the first person I slept with who I truly loved. He’s been around for years. Our relationship started as best friends and blossomed into romance. 

However, he’s lied, cheated, ignored me, insulted me, gaslights me beyond belief, and it seems he’s embarrassed by me. 

Why do I still care? How do I move past this? I feel I cannot confide in my friends anymore as this all took place a year ago, and surely they’re tired of hearing it. 

Any and all advise is welcome, no matter how brutally honest. Please, help me."

"Sorry this might be a bit all over the place and ranty.

 By the way I am 26F he is 23M 

Yesterday in the car sitting in the parking lot after his doctors appointment. After I said I didn’t feel like going to his mothers for dinner with him last night. He flipped and got so hysterical. I said you’re not driving my car anywhere, I tried to grab my keys, he twisted my arm. He said “get in or I’m taking your car”, I stepped back and said okay. He took off. 

I can’t even say how many scenarios like this that have occurred in the past 4 years but I just can’t do it anymore. He is out of control. My dad is on his way from my home state, getting a uhaul and moving me back and I am living with my sister till I figure it out. 

He is mentally unwell and refuses real treatment besides dropping massive amounts of psychedelics. I truly want my life with him and feel like I always will. I imagine it all together. I love him beyond I ever knew was possible. But he is abusive. Controlling. And truthfully, not a good person. I’ve used his mental illness as a crutch, but at the end of the day I just don’t think he is a good person in addition to that. He is mean and angry and I know it’s because he is in pain. 

I am not angry and never have been with him, no matter how awful he has been to me. I am only capable of feeling compassion for him. Could have called the cops yesterday but I do not want to mess up or add to what he already has going on, (yes I know he does this to himself). I can’t bring myself to do it. I want the best for him. STILL. And I just am mourning a loss with someone I wanted my life with. Regardless of it all. My head is messed up

He wasn’t always like this. He always had issues and has been mentally ill, but the anger/issues were very RARELY directed at me. It’s just been the past month or so it’s been like this. I don’t really understand but sometimes I feel like I do. I feel bad for giving up. I miss him. He is so angry with me all the time.. he’s always had problems but in 4 years it’s rarely been directed at me. Until about a month ago. It’s all me. 

 I’m still here in the same town as him until tomorrow or Sunday and it is so tempting. But I can’t and shouldn’t. I just want to tell him I love him one last time. 


I am getting therapy as soon as possible back in my home state (400 miles away). I am so afraid of this feeling of missing him again. I will likely be frequently posting as I desperately need support. Reading all your different posts and stories has already been so helpful. 

Thank you all for being you and for sharing and for being here."

Is anyone really able to give me a hand with this
"I am pretty sure I’m in an abusive relationship. Most recently my partner said some very mean and degrading things. Since that day, when I said I would no longer participate in that conversation. My partner has not talked to me/responded to me/ been home. We have been going to couples therapy for months now. My partner did not show up for our session. There is this cycle of going great and the absolutely horrible. I do not understand how my partner is upset when they were the one is be nasty. How long do I stick with being disregarded? How long do I keep working to be ignored for DAYS? If I pack up all my shit, I want closure, for myself. Though I am not sure I can actually leave. I don’t want to be a failure."
