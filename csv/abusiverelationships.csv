It's especially hard to move on during this pandemic. I still have feelings of anger towards them. I cant get over the fact that they lied to me throughout the relationship and victimize themselves after. They will never acknowledge that they have extremely toxic traits.

"Hi everyone.

I have considered posting here before when I was still in my abusive relationship, but was ultimately too ashamed of the situation to reach out or speak on it. But now I‚Äôm in a different boat. I have a loving boyfriend who understands my trauma and is comforting. 

However, this past week has been nearly too much to even bear. A friend of my current boyfriend posted about having to call the police on the guy she was seeing (my ex) because he got physically violent. 

It‚Äôs brought up horrible memories and flashbacks, and I‚Äôm having a really hard time coping. I don‚Äôt see my new therapist for two weeks, and I feel like no one really knows what to say. Hoping for some kind words, support, of advice. TYIA"
"It‚Äôs hard to cope right now without making a total mess of myself. I cope in unhealthy ways. I considered psychiatric care, or going to the hospital for a night. Last time I saw my ex was weeks ago and I feel so lost. I feel hurt. I don‚Äôt know what‚Äôs real sometimes. There‚Äôs so much happening on top of this break up. I‚Äôm trying so hard. Things keep changing. I need to get through this shit.  I can‚Äôt handle these feelings and emotions that are so powerful."
"I got so frustrated listening to another two hour  barrage of ‚Äúyou did this to me, you‚Äôre the one at fault, your family are murdering scum (brother was in the navy 20 years ago)‚Äù that I hurt myself.....ended up banging my fists into my head and I now have two bruises in the middle of my forehead.  Trying to control my crying because when I get upset at how I am being spoken to ‚ÄúI am emotionally manipulating the situation so I don‚Äôt have to talk about it!!‚Äù Never done this before but it helped......scared I‚Äôm going to end up on a slippery slope."
"I know that my relationship is unhealthy, but I don‚Äôt feel as though I am in a position to leave. We (kids dad/me/kids) have to find a new lease within the next three months. Realistically, we need one another to afford to move into a new place. How do I navigate the next 6-12 months within the relationship to set myself up to move forward? There‚Äôs a lot of control on his part, so I feel like I can‚Äôt try to better myself openly or he will start tearing me down. How do I set myself and my kids up?"
"My narcissistic and abusive ex has gotten back in touch with me.
When I confronted him on his cheating he said he did it as a test to see if he could trust me to respect his privacy. 

And he said his reason for calling me was because the spirits of my dead grandparents visited him and told him that they were sorry I was so ‚Äúcruel‚Äù to him and that I would own up and apologise if he reached out to me.

This from the guy who used to lock me out of our house in the cold without a jacket or keys to teach me a lesson because my period cramps annoyed him.

He even told me I imagined having a miscarriage. 

He tried to convince me I was autistic with BPD and he‚Äôs telling people I‚Äôm a diagnosed schizophrenic.

This guy drove two of his ex girlfriends to suicide. 

I hate him so much."
""
"So I left this morning after he threatened to call the police on me.

I went to my parents house and told them I was moving back after dinner.
I told him I wasn't ready to talk with him about it yet.

He rings me, at 3am, to ask where his Xbox is üò§üò§

And proceeds to ask me when I'm gonna talk to him about moving out and I said I want my Mum there (not unreasonable to me, I turned 19 less than a week ago) and he started saying that he didn't feel the need to drag his parents into it (sore spot for me bc he often shamed me about relying on my parents).
He asks to have our flatmate there and I say no (I feel very unsafe around her for different reasons), and he says it'll have to be alone then.

He then goes on for a minute abt how time sensitive it is and pressuring me to do it tomorrow before we just decide to talk abt boundaries tomorrow and I say goodbye before I agree to something stupid."

I finally deleted my last way of contacting her and it feels good like a weight lifted off of me. Our time together may have been shorter than most of the peoples experiences but it hit me hard due to my history. And i finally feel like i can start really healing
I've been really down and depressed the last few days. The words he said to me scarred deep. I know I shouldn't listen to them but being called worthless and a throw away object is really painful to me. I dont know why I keep wanting him to just call and say he's sorry. I know he never will and I should stay no contact. Can someone just give me some words of encouragement through this rough patch?

"An argument between my husband and I escalated this morning over a missing sleeping bag.

I walked out after he told me that he was sick of me...and that I bring nothing to this relationship...and to make it a daily project of mine to think of something that I actually bring to our relationship.

Are you freaking kidding me???

I am NOT going to come up with an excuse every day to prove that we should stay in a relationship.

I have to constantly defend myself as a wife...as a mother...as a worker (I work long hours running HIS business, while he stays home)....even as a woman.

I'm tired...I stopped fighting for our relationship a long time ago. He is now noticing....but that is also MY fault.

I accept my faults....he has none...therefore all problems are of my own causing.

Sorry for rambling...my head is in a million directions because I am still so mad!!

I want to leave...but have nowhere to go...no family and women's refuge is slammed"

"i was casually going through social media when i saw my abuser on my cousin's story. it immediately sent me into a panic attack and it was so hard to get myself to calm down and stop shaking. i am still SO upset because my cousin literally knew all the messed up things my abuser would tell me/do to me. i can't believe he's still cool with my abuser and it truly baffles me because my cousin and i are so close. then i started freaking out when thinking about what he could've possibly told my abuser, such as that i've moved or other things i've been up to. I'm still in disbelief honestly, and i'm quite freaked out because i just want to move on but it feels like my abuser continues to slip his way into my life"
""
"Hi guys, this is something that I've been wondering about. Something that is really common in abusive relationships is that you never get the closure that you want about it being abuse and the person in the relationship never admits that they deliberately hurt you over and over again, which is even more emotional abuse for the person to deal with. But then I'm confused about this because I've also read about how narcissists 'hoover' their victims, which can often involve them admitting all the bad things they've done and apologising to manipulate their victim into staying with them and thinking they've changed. So which is it? Do narcissists/abusers admit to their abuse or do they not?"
""
"So, I read constantly all these stories and I want to relate. A lot of them I can. I need advice from survivors or abusers idc. I was with him for 10 years. Raised his 2 kids for 8 years and we had one of our own a year ago. Hes very verbally abusive, he doesn't have any good family or friends. He is... Angry and neglectful. If not for the 12 year old...I would be lost. He leaves the baby with the older kids. He knows I don't agree with it. He cheated and decided we are over. So I'm moving out with the baby...he is saying I cannot move away, however for my sanity I cannot stay here locally. We have no court arrangements and I don't want to go to court due to the things I will be forced to disclose about him....bc I won't lose my daughter in any fashion. It's all very toxic. I feel I have lost 2 of my children and my entire life so....I'd like to start clean with the baby ..he says that's not right or ok.... What do you think??"
"I finally left my abuser but now I don't know what to do, like I guess restraining order paperwork and whatnot but I'm kinda afraid to leave my house because i might see him or he might find me. Also I don't know if I'm ready for therapy or not. I know I should talk about it but it's just SO MUCH, if you know what I mean. Part of me wishes I could just move on and pretend like it never happened, but as my boss reminded me I have to step up for all the other women that have been through this and not allow him to hurt anyone else. how do you process your emotions because I feel like if I talk about it ill just start crying and never stop, and I'm REALLY! over crying, like I've cried enough for 4 lifetimes it feels like. Ughhhh I just want to be happy again."
"Okay, you know you did The right thing... you have all the reasons to just walk away and never regret it... BUT WHY THIS DOESN'T HAPPEN??

Everytime i try to stop talking to her i can only stay strong for 2 days...max.

Not talking to her gives me a lot of anxiety, like I'm suffocating...its awful. Why can't I remind myself of all the things that happened and just walk away?

I've created a fantasy in my head, that our relationship was good and happy. But even during the happy moments there was always something to ""contaminate"" and kill the mood of happiness...such as jealousy, abruptly humor changes and so on...

Any tips?"

"My ex and I have been broken up for a few months and I recently found out that he didn‚Äôt love me for the last year of our relationship, yet he stayed and made me believe that he loved me. We tried to stay friends while broken up but obviously that didn‚Äôt work. 

He made a list of things he hated about me, mostly about kids (I don‚Äôt want them) and my physical limitations (knee injury) that could prevent me from doing things. 

He made me feel like I was the problem, that I am a useless and worthless human being. But at the same time he would string me along with the hope that we could work things out and be together again. 

After our last conversation I have realized it was never my fault, I put everything into our relationship but I can‚Äôt help feeling used

"I asked my husband to move out at the beginning of 2020. We have been together for over 10 years. I didn‚Äôt realize I was in an emotional abusive relationship until recently I talked to a psychiatrist. I just knew I was not happy and I was no longer myself. I felt alone, ignored and distracted. I was told all kinds of reasons for my needs not being met. I‚Äôm really glad I freed myself from this marriage and this relationship. I have support from my family and friends. It‚Äôs my birthday next week, and I just now realize I actually feel like I don‚Äôt deserve anything good. I think it‚Äôs because I have not gotten any birthday nor Christmas gifts through out my marriage and I learned to convince myself it‚Äôs because I wasn‚Äôt being good enough.

I'd like to hear from people who are in healthy and loving relationships. Do you not argue, or do you argue in a healthy way? I have been in a relationship for 8 years now and it seems like i am always in a fight and feeling exhausted and beaten down and I've finally realized that this is what emotional abuse looks like. I'm wondering if this is how it is for everyone or if there are better things out there. Thank you"
It's been 5 months since I left my emotionally abusive ex. I still have reoccuring dreams of her and the pain she caused me. I've seen other people casually since but I only feel it's to distract myself from the immense un-dealt pain that is still within me. I'm mad at myself for still having feelings for her after what she did to me. Still feeling deep anger at her and her male best friend that she cheated with behind my back.  I hope this goes in time because I truly feel like I'm putting a mental/emotional block between myself and others because I'm so afraid of getting close again. For becoming vulnerable again. Any inspiring bounce back stories would be welcomed &lt;3

My ex boyfriend was extremely gaslights that he made multiple ‚Äúpeople‚Äù to harass me and belittle my mental illness or to get a pretend job that i never had in the first place. I have a hard time leaving him since everytime we talk it always makes me feel like I am the toxic one? Does anyone else have experience like thos?
"I am in a phase right now where I am just angry beyond repair. I‚Äôm thinking about all the shit he did over the last 6 years and how it doesn‚Äôt phase him. I am left with PTSD and extreme anxiety and cannot get on with my life- and he is apparently living the dream and traveling , and got $3k from me to sit pretty in his apartment for free for two months. Always claimed he would never cheat, and I can think of about 15 instances in the span of 2 minutes of times where he did something shady which led me to believe he cheated. Made excuses each and every time and got called crazy for it. 
I want to move forward with my life and get to a point where I don‚Äôt care. But I am so angry right now I could cry and I don‚Äôt even know what to do like I can‚Äôt take it."

I did a thing and went on a date with someone.  It‚Äôs been almost 7 months since I left my ex.  Been with my ex for 7 years.  Abusive from the start.  he really made me feel so ugly.   But I went on a date tonight.   It really surprised me that someone would be nice enough to open my door to pay for food.  To literally compliment me.  It just really shocked me.  Iv been treated like trash for so long.  I forgot there are good people in this world.
"So today while being harassed by someone on a sub about makeup, the person I was talking to obviously went through my profile and then tried to use the fact I was in an abusive relationship to insult me. The thread was then linked on another sub which makes fun of reddit conversations where people said things like ‚ÄúWomen, am I right?‚Äù and ‚ÄúGreat find‚Äù. I was incredibly horrified not only by someone thinking the fact I was abused was ok for them to bring up and try and insult me because of, and then for that conversation to be put onto another sub labelled ‚Äúdrama‚Äù and made fun of? Disgusting. Just needed to vent, as I was horrified my profile was scrutinized and they thought that part of my past was acceptable to bring into the conversation."

It's been 12 years and I'm sure anyone in this group knows you're not the same person after years in an abusive relationship. It happens slowly and you slowing take more and more shit and the more you deteriorate the worse he treats you. The old me would have never let this happen. She was smart and spunky and would have found a way to beat the minuplitation. This me can't,  I just let it happen, cry, scream, fight, and give him more power. How do you become the person you were before? If I don't find her I'm in some serious trouble.

"Potential Trigger Warning ‚ö†Ô∏è

Hi guys - I wanted to put trigger warning just incase because I‚Äôd like to share what has happened today in hope of some advice...

This morning my partner woke up and he wasn‚Äôt feeling very well (I believe he has been on a come down as he may have drugs two days ago) and he was complaining about feeling poorly. He grabbed me by the neck with not a lot of force but there was force and shook me saying how unwell he is and his throat/nose is hurting. I felt so small and I really genuinely felt scared. It made me think and vision what else he would and could do to me. Is this abusive behaviour? Or am I being sensitive? I wouldn‚Äôt do this to my partner or friends even as a joke."
"I‚Äôve been free and no-contact for almost 2 years. But I still have nightmares about him that feel so real. Sometimes I‚Äôm just back there and never left. Sometimes I‚Äôm trying to escape. Sometimes he finds me. Sometimes I have my daughter and sometimes she‚Äôs not there. Sometimes he attacks me (and/or my daughter) and sometimes he‚Äôs sickeningly nice and I‚Äôm waiting for the other shoe to drop. There‚Äôs even been a few where I‚Äôm speaking to his mom and terrified he‚Äôll find out. 

I‚Äôm lucky enough to be several states away from him so I think the chances of him actually coming here are very low, but it doesn‚Äôt change how scary the dreams are. I think the holidays make me have more, but they still happen the rest of the year, too. 

I just woke up from one I was trying to pack all my stuff before he came home and just the fear and dread was too much. Has anyone else had this? When if ever did they stop? Or at least become rare? I hate that he still lives in my dreams."

This became clear to me very recently and I need to put it in words.
My wife of 18 years is suffering from the suicide of our son. He was just 25.
Since this happened she has made it clear that she ‚Äúdoes not like people ‚Äú. Period.
Her father (85) lives with us as does our daughter (29), who is also on the autism spectrum.
First, she is ‚Äúwaiting for him to leave or die‚Äù.
Second, she has been very ‚Äúunkind ‚Äú to me and looks like she wants me to leave or die.
Third, she has cultivated a codependent relationship with the daughter to ensure that the daughter lives with her in perpetuity. She has actively sought to ruin our family financially and emotionally.

It makes me wonder, why are you telling me this? If you didn't cheat on me, why are you telling me there's no infidelity. This started me thinking: is it out of a guilty conscious? Did he cheat on me?  He has admitted he cheated on a former ex-wife (I think it was a two - three-year affair).

Even posion ivy grows... but that doesn't necessarily mean that you want it in your garden.

He is an invasive species, and will continue to thrive at the expense of those around him...  that's how he operates, and no one knows that better than me.

I just won't be letting him squander my resources to survive and thrive any longer.

Its best to focus on the Karma I'm creating for myself, and not sit around waiting for the Karma he's created to come after him.  I've wasted enough time on him.  It's time to start investing in me. üé§üíØüéØ"
"He raped me the first time we done it. It was in 2018, we never knew each other in person we knew each other online for maybe 10 months and I've been debating pressing charges, I've been toxic towards him and we planned on getting kids plus marriage in our life together. I haven't spoken to him since I came back home. He keeps messaging my mom and he's stalked my social media forcing me to reply to him stating I wish you best of luck we just weren't a good couple God bless. I feel like I need to stick up for myself and day you know what X i said God bless so."

"I'm coming out of an abusive relationship and stilll processing a lot of things.  Right now I'm reflecting on phrases as stated in the title ""I worked so hard for us"", ""I worked hard to give us a good life"", ""I want you to be happy"", or something to that effect

My ex had a truly terrible life-work balance and we had many conversations about it.  I eventually reached a point where I stopped trying, or even caring.

I was if anyone else's ex used phrases like these.  It's like they're making themselves out to be a hero, or a matyr and all you wanted is to spend some time with them."

"Mine went for a trip with his friend during our first Christmas and New Year. He has never talked to me about this plan in advance. He just decided himself. I had talked to him about my problematic family and didn't have anyone to be with during holidays, yet he did this to me, leaving me all alone at home.

This really pissed me off. 

He did many other bad things like raping and insulting me, but this is one of the most early signs I can remember. I left him, but am still hemorrhaging due to the injuries he caused."
Please anyone that can hep with $50 or anything I would appreciate your help. I start my job this upcoming Monday. Please message me if you can help. My now ex has been physically and mentally abusive and I no longer have a place to stay. Help please üòîüò©

"If you boyfriend/girlfriend blocks your number because he/she is mad at you, is that considered a form of abuse?"

A fairy god mother and an old grandfather later I found out the abusive people around me were not ok with education and exercise and then further down the road no more attention span or memory so I‚Äôm a little afraid my brain will come out my ear soon...

"What are the bizarre reactions you have received from people when you have spoken openly about the abuse you went through?

I‚Äôll start by adding - what did you do?"
"I left him the first time he put his hands on me. It has been about a month ago and I packed a suitcase I became homeless I never went back. I'm now in a shelter and hoping to remain safe although now I'm in a very vulnurable position I feel like I did what was right. I have regrets and I rationalize saying that I provoked him and that he didn't punch me he just grabbed me and shook me. 
We talked yesterday for the first time since the incident. And he said he would never do it again he promised. He cried I cried. Today the after effects of that phone call are lingering heavily and I am so sad and confused. Can anyone relate"
"I‚Äôve been out of my abusive relationship for almost a full year now. I still find myself missing the chaos of that relationship, and still questioning my sanity about it. It was my first serious relationship and the first time feeling ‚Äúlove‚Äù and now I‚Äôm having the hardest time understanding affection in my new relationship"
"He hasn't gotten help which he promised, but he hasn't hurt me for a few months now and I know he's trying to do better.

However, I've still been miserably depressed. We were supposed to move into a new flat but he changed his mind and I feel like he always chooses himself over me/us.

Yesterday he said to stop moaning at him or he would leave me. I asked him what I moan about, other than the living situation, and he couldn't give me an answer.

That comment has taken me back to feeling like I don't have a voice, like I'm worthless. Back to the many times he has lied to me, hit me or worst of all raped me, and when I cried about it and expected him to talk to me about it, he'd shout at me to shut up about it or fuck off. I feel so small."

"  So after my childhood with mom and step dad then going through physical &amp; mental abuse at the age of 14, my abuser 18. Therapist said a lot of other people would've already committed suicide or lead a completely different life has anyone ever thought about writing a book about all of it?"

"Im hoping to get my vehicle fixed and then drive myself somewhere I can stay for a few months. I will have to stay with my mom who is an alcoholic, but at  this point it feels like heaven.

It doesn't seem safe for me to break up with him first. That would put me in danger. But it is my house, and I can't afford to move. I will lose my education. If I just leave there's no guarantee he will leave. Or, leave without breaking things/leaving the door unlocked/taking the key.

If I get the police involved, much worse things will happen. Having all my money taken and being raped and belittled daily is a lot better than what will happen to me if I call the police. No one believes me. I don't know what to do."

How did you overcome all those feelings? How did you overcome the anger from not being heard? How did you overcome the frustration from feeling irrelevant to your partner? How did you overcome the general feeling of illness that their behaviour had induce into you?

"Hello, I'm just venting but sometimes I just want to stay in a hotel and not return. I have 1 daughter and live with my partner. Life is seemingly okay, but I just want to get away. We don't even sleep next to each other, sex is very routine, and when I want to sleep in he constantly barges in the room. I have no where quiet to retreat to. I'm afraid to go because either I won't want to come back or he might take our daughter to live with his mom. I feel like a coward because I can't be myself. I don't talk about my anxiety or depression with him because he is not trustworthy with that information. I'm just sick of everyone right now."

"So five days ago, I decided I was done. I called up my sister for a place to stay, I made a loose plan, I talked to my therapist about it. I felt so happy if also scared. Decided to do it in the next 2 weeks. I‚Äôve done my best to hide it from him because he can be abusive when he is upset and I wanted to move out while he was at work one day. 

And now he is being the sweetest boyfriend in the world. Usually he refuses to show me affection and now he is showering me with it. He is listening to me, he is sharing things with me, he is doing thoughtful and kind things for me. And it‚Äôs working. 

I‚Äôm so frustrated!! It‚Äôs almost like he knows somehow and is trying to pull me back in. I KNOW this isn‚Äôt going to last but I suddenly can‚Äôt make myself leave. It‚Äôs like I‚Äôm watching myself get sucked back in and I‚Äôm like ‚Äúdon‚Äôt do it!!!!‚Äù But it‚Äôs still happening. 

Just venting... I know nothing will change in the relationship. I just want to WANT to leave again."
Do any of your abusers do passive aggressive stuff? Like my husband gets mad at an LED light being left on in my kids room so when said husband goes to bed after everyone else is asleep he turns every light in the house on (except bedrooms where people are asleep). So I wake up to find all these lights on and wasting our money but don't say anything because I know if I do it will turn into blaming me for my kids leaving their LED lights on.
"I tried posting on r/legaladvice but there was no traction.

He should not know where I live, however, silly me has been purchasing this monthly food delivery from his friend (basically sister in law‚Äôs) company.  Unfortunately, that means she has my address. 


Can a company that I purchase from legally share my home address with there friend/family? Company is based out of CO if that is helpful information.

"Why is it so hard to leave them? I've been in a relationship with my partner for almost 3 years. The red flags have been there since the beginning. He's charming, lovely, the best until his CPTSD gets triggered by any number of things. Then he gets abusive and it's always my fault. And he gaslights me and drives me crazy to the point where I reactive in an abusive way.

Not my first time dating an abusive narcissistic. Always ends the same. Why is it so hard to leave. I have BPD and always feel like I'm never enough and won't ever find someone better. 

Idk? Advice?"
"I don't want to blow this out of proportion, but it's beginning to trouble me. The way he jokes sometimes makes me worried.

My partner (23m) has never lashed out in anger at me (25f), and is normally kind and affectionate. When he's angry, he doesn't yell or get violent. However, he has (a few times raised his hand) to hit me jokingly or put his hands around my neck as if to choke me (again, jokingly). This has happened only a couple of times but it has stuck with me. 

Some other jokes are worrying in other ways. For example, if we're napping together and I wake him before him and go and do chores or work, he will make a lot of remarks about me 'abandoning' him and that I don't love him. It can go on for up to 30 min. I'm a really sensitive person, and I feel real guilt when this happens. Other times, when I want affection he'll push me away and jokingly call me a whore. He often remarks I'm being too tense or sensitive and I need to lighten up."
"He stole my car about a year and a half ago.

Finally sold my ex fianc√©‚Äôs (men‚Äôs wedding band). It was so hard to get rid of that ring. It just was like my reminder of all my effort and everything. I drove out of state a few hours to get the ring for him. But the original ring I had gotten him he made me return because it was too plain. So I bought this one to make him happy and it had the diamonds and everything that he wanted. It really should have been üö©üö© but I just wanted to make him happy. It‚Äôs just a final letting go of everything from the relationship that was not good. Just makes me feel sad but in a way relieved. I‚Äôve been now 3+ weeks no contact with him.

I‚Äôm not trying to be sexist, and if it comes off that way, oh well but I do know there are some other males in this group who could possibly shed some light on why I keep falling for the wrong girls. Are there any red flags or statements I should look out for if I ever decide to try again?"

i remember texting her saying i was watching it. i love his shows and his use of psychology, misdirection and overal knowledge of how to push people to do what he wants. i mentioned to her that if i were in one of these hidden camera shows, i'd totally be manipulated.

she did not like that at all. she was very aggressive in her messages to me, suggesting that i was weak minded and overall just giving me lots of shit for saying that. looking back, that was a massive red flag that i ignored.

Her insecurity went above the levels that's what I think.

No. I don't do cheating whatsoever. I just needed time to recenter my mind, recalibrate my bearings and to unwind. Without the time my mind will turn haywire.

"I‚Äôm at a point where I have no strengh anymore. I barely get out of bed. I don‚Äôt even talk to anyone anymore, not even my family.. I don‚Äôt want to be hit anymore, but I can‚Äôt seem to resist him. I‚Äôm too weak and I feel like on my last breath. Tried hanging myself last night, but unfortunately the stair rail broke from my weight. I want to leave him, but I can‚Äôt. I don‚Äôt have hope anymore ...."

"My wife is hot and cold with her behavior sometimes.  I‚Äôm on the verge of leaving and divorcing. Yet the past several days. She‚Äôs been nice, considerate and bubbly.  Makes me wonder if counseling may work. Although I know the other her is around the corner. It gives me pause. 

Anybody here ever successfully reconciled ?"
"hi. 

i don't know if this is the correct sub, if not, I apologize but I'm wondering if this has also happened to any other abuse survivors... 

so, a bit over a year ago I left an abusive relationship that lasted about 4 years. it was bad. i was abused mentally, emotionally, physically, sexually... it left a lot of trauma that I'm still working through to this day but i've felt brave enough to consider dating again, except, I discovered I'm not attracted to men like I was before. I had a date last week with a boy I thought I liked a lot, but when it came to being physical it was very weird for me. I lowkey felt disgusted, which tripped me out a lot. i've always considered myself bi/pansexual so liking genders aside from men has always been a thing for me but to NOT be attracted to men at all is completely new. Could it possibly be my trauma making me push all men away? i dont even know who to talk to about it that could relate/understand... 

again, sorry if this isn't the right sub."
There was a moment S. Made me feel ugly and undesirable. Today I found out after a post of a picture I made in a group the amount of likes I received were more than I expected. People are still liking my picture. It surpassed than what I expected. Yes I have self esteem issues and he made them worse. I am not ugly or undesirable and have a good soul.  S. Was the one with the the void and ugly in the inside that it was eventually seeping out of his body. I still ask myself how can I love someone that was abusive to me. It‚Äôs not hard to make me cry thinking about him bc I still love him and it sickens me that i still do. I loved hims so much even his ugly side. What is wrong with me!
"I‚Äôve been working on myself since my last post. I‚Äôm still afraid of liking someone. I hate the feeling of love. It feels weird but I know even if the person likes me back I will still feel bad. How can I trust men again? How can I stop being afraid of them controlling me? People said that the right person will change you and make you feel comfortable, but I‚Äôm not sure I believe that. I want to trust but don‚Äôt know where to start. If you could help me I would greatly appreciate it."
"I should be happy, right? I didn‚Äôt even have to be the one that left. He left me. Of course, without a warning. Just kinda left me to wonder. But it‚Äôs been 4 days &amp; he hasn‚Äôt been home. So it‚Äôs done, right? I feel so abandoned. Which is bullshit. And I should feel awesome. I should feel free. But I don‚Äôt. Fuck."
"I don't really know how to start this. My partner is physically abusive. I've been pushed, cornered, thrown on the bed, have been bruised. The worst was on my birthday. The last incident was Nov 6th. After that I told him to get a therapist by the end of the month or else I would be done. He did, but I'm really scared that it's going to happen again. We live together, and I don't even know if I want to/can move because he owes me 2 months of rent and bills.

I'm tired of being accused of having a personality disorder - my therapist (used to be our couples therapist) has told me that it's normal for symptoms to show up in abusive therapists and he doesn't think I have BPD.

I'm deeply hurt. I know the resources in my community, I know the hotline phone number. I know I need to escape, but why am I so scared to? He calls it my ""push pull behavior"""
"
And when you do say something, or try to ACTUALLY have a discussion (where you‚Äôre BOTH recognizing your own role which caused an argument) they say ‚Äòthat‚Äôs the most stupid thing I ever heard. No one thinks like this, you‚Äôre so strange you‚Äôre the only person with this thinking‚Äô or if you ever get slightly flustered because you‚Äôre trying to explain over and over again how him calling you names might hurt you and he refuses to understand, so in the end you get annoyed... then he says ‚Äòlook how worked up you‚Äôre getting... you do not know how to discuss‚Äô 

And then you get called childish and immature for not being able to have an adult discussion, but in reality... having an adult discussion TO THEM is just them talking AT YOU about all your faults and you listen and grovel."

They think men need to treat women horribly and make them bow down to them. They think that if they make women happy then they‚Äôll get too inspired that there are better things out there and then they‚Äôll leave. I found a man who actually treats me right and I‚Äôve never been more happy to stay.
"Even a whole year after me breaking up with him, I still think back to events and question whether I'm the abusive one or not. He told me I was abusive all the time, I still question it to this day. I feel like I was responding to how he treated me and not in necessarily healthy ways but the only way I knew how. And maybe I do have abusive tendency but sometimes I think he just manipulated me so bad that I can't get it out of my head."

"I finally did it and left him today. The verbal abuse was unbearable and I've had enough. I did it in the worst possible way though- sent him a text and blocked him on everything. I can't help feeling awful for him, is that normal?"
"there‚Äôs a guy i like who is mean to me. i ghosted him once before but we started talking again. even before i ghosted him he was mean. the whole relationship is me walking on eggshells. i can‚Äôt say how i feel because he can‚Äôt admit his defeats. i told him once that he hurt me and he said i hurt him first when i ghosted him. obviously i regret ghosting him, but ik him and if i told him why, he would explode. idk what to do"

"Its only been 2 days since I packed up what I could of me and my kid's stuff and left.There were a lot of belongings and presents left behind for my child and me and our pet had to stay there as well. After tons of love bombing,I factory reset my phone and changed my number and got off their phone plan on to my own plan.I am still scared my every word being typed is being watched since they had total remote control over my phone in the past even though they showed me proof that the spyware was cancelled almost a year ago.I find myself craving their affection and wanting to go back to that but I know that's all part of the cycle and I absolutely cannot.I want to puke,cry,scream,laugh,jump,and sing simultaneously. I'm scared as shit and excited at the same time."
"I left my abusive relationship about five months ago (I‚Äôm a 20F and he was a 22M) and for a while I was doing really well. I was hopeful, went out, even had fun with talking to guys on tinder (just for fun nothing serious), and actually felt somewhat good, but now I‚Äôm super depressed about everything. I can‚Äôt stop thinking about it. I have vivid flashbacks, I spend hours thinking about the things he said to me and all the lies he told that I missed at the time. I even have dreams about him countless nights in row. Actually after having dreams about him for 3 nights he contacted me for the first time in months to try and ‚Äúapologize‚Äù (i ignored and blocked him and I don‚Äôt regret this) and I thought maybe it would give me closure but it didn‚Äôt. I still can‚Äôt stop. I feel heartbroken and worthless again, and so so emotionally unavailable to everyone. Has anyone else experienced this months after it has ended, even after feeling pretty good for a while?"

"He still sends me messages, his friends and colleagues, his parents, everyone keeps sending me texts and calling me and they don‚Äôt realise I‚Äôm the victim.

I went across the country to be safe from my abuser. He was so manipulative and narcissistic. I am so proud of myself. But it was over 28+ of time with driving, hotels, stops for gas.

"I've noticed that my girlfriend has been very controlling and emotionally abusive for the past few months. I've forgiven it and continued on in our relationship. Only now she wants desperately to have unprotected sex, saying she'll buy plan b afterwards. Only to get mad at me when I tell her that no, I haven't bought plan b (because I'm not agreeing to have unprotected sex). She constantly brings it up and gets mad when I ask why it is she wants it unprotected so bad if she doesn't want a baby.
 
I constantly get the silent treatment and treated as if I did some horrible crime or something terribly wrong, yet it's usually something small and insignificant. 

Am I to blame in all of this? Please help guide me"

"I went over to a family members house for a Christmas dinner and gift exchange. Told my boyfriend where I was going and that i might be unavailable for a short period of time.

Ive been in a few abusive relationships and i grew up with it as well. Now that I'm aware. For myself I feel that the scariest form of abuse is the slow and quiet kind. The repetitive comments that are said though youve asked them to stop. The nonchalant statements made to and in front of outsiders that seem meh but force you to defend yourself which is already a nonstop ongoing process with the manipulator. Its terrifying when they say these things with a smile knowing its killing another piece inside of you. Thats when you are truly alone and hopeless for rescue. I was a child trafficking victim ive had my ex choke and hit and strangle and cheat and scream. The scariest is when the words are so often over a long time meant to coerce and terrify.
"Good morning. 

It‚Äôs Christmas Eve and I‚Äôm already anxious my texting abuser will make me text him all day. I don‚Äôt want to. 

And I can be firm and say I‚Äôm not texting. But then it‚Äôll set him off and ruin my holiday. 

I absolutely hate the mind control part of this! :("

I‚Äôm honestly heart broken.

I‚Äôve not even thought about speaking to other guys and he‚Äôs doing this?!
Wow what a great Christmas present... I feel so confused"
I‚Äôve been in a physical/emotionally abusive relationship for 5 years &amp; am planning on leaving. I‚Äôm in my homestate but fly back tomorrow. She knows i‚Äôm on this trip to see if i just miss home or if i really want to leave. She‚Äôll probably want to know my decision tomorrow but i don‚Äôt want to ruin christmas eve/xmas. I don‚Äôt know if i should just tell her after? It‚Äôs going to be hard no matter what i think she‚Äôs expecting everything to be okay when i get back.

"I think being being alone after the moments of abuse are some of the hardest to face. I feel like I have no one to turn to. No one to talk to. Just me, my scared dog, an empty house, and my wrecked emotions. I just wanna know that I'm not alone in this feeling. We've all had to be here once or more.. I know it's going to be okay. But where do I go from here is something I don't want to think about. I'm just hurt. And I'm upset to even think that having a conversation can fix what's happened. I can make excuses for him all day, but I don't want to look back on this day when the next bad one comes around and ask myself why this again?"

"My abuser is an addict. Has been our entire relationship. I believe this addiction made him abusive. He was a different person before the addiction.

He‚Äôs alone for Christmas and there‚Äôs a huge chance he might kill himself. I feel so much guilt and responsibility. I‚Äôve talked to my therapist and she tells me I cannot be responsible for his choices. But oh my god if he hurts himself it‚Äôll be my fault and maybe I could of stopped it.

"I was so happy, just to know that some one out there wanted my opinion on all of this. He asked me things such as all my experiences of assault, his family and their issues, and all my experiences of his abusive/manipulative manner. It was wonderful to have such a great officer to work with. He was so understanding, and he really seemed to care about every little thing I had to say. It has lifted some of the weight off of me.

Thank you, kind Probation Officer"
"After a very long and crazy two weeks, my ex is on their way home. (They moved out of state to be here with me.)

I‚Äôm absolutely exhausted. I stood up for myself, which resulted in them breaking up with me and when I agreed they threatened suicide. Well, it all ended in a welfare check, them being held at a hospital for awhile, and then lots of work to get in contact with a friend who agreed to help get them back home.

I‚Äôm so drained and sad. And even though they were horrible and it is NOT okay for me to ever talk to them again, I miss them? I don‚Äôt understand it."

" I got myself into another abusive relationship and I don‚Äôt know how I didn‚Äôt see the signs again. My ex and I were together for five months and lived together for the last three. My friends hated him from the start and basically told me to stay away from him but I couldn‚Äôt. Everything moved so fast but he seemed so genuine and with covid moving in seemed normal. I work from home and obviously couldn‚Äôt see people due to covid restrictions. But I don‚Äôt know how I didn‚Äôt see the signs beyond that, they were so basic, isolation, love-bombing, jealously, mood swings. I just feel so stupid. I‚Äôm safe now, but if it hadn‚Äôt been for friends finding my apartment and physically removing me, I don‚Äôt know if I would have been. 

I'm sorry this is just a vent, but any advice on seeing the signs in the moment, even if they're clear in hindsight, would be appreciated."
"Hi everyone. First time poster, long time redditor . I just have to know. When did you start to notice the abusive behavior with a partner or ex partner? In the beginning of the relationship, longer down the road? Were there warning signs or did it just happen suddenly? 

My heart goes out to all of you"
Does anyone wonder if the reason they repeatedly find themselves in abusive relationships (even beyond romantic) with people is because maybe you find healthy relationships boring or not challenging enough?

"He doesn‚Äôt want custody, that was granted to me. He wants the lowest child support possible, and he wants to hurt me in every way he can. He wants the kids to still hold their last name knowing I want it changed to mine because he has NO intentions of seeing them or caring for them. It‚Äôs been two years without child support and we‚Äôre back in court again because he still isn‚Äôt happy with the amount they‚Äôre asking. He‚Äôs underemployed in the judge‚Äôs opinion and refuses to work a full time job. Everything I told him in the past about my anxiety and depression while we were together, he is going to use against me. He is torturing me over an abortion I felt I needed to have. Things he was once ‚Äúloving‚Äù about are now being used as weapons. I am an idiot for ever confusing and trusting in him. But he seemed like a completely different person than he does right now.

"I recently found out my ex was talking badly about me. I‚Äôm apparently one of the most psychotic people he‚Äôs ever even talked to. The thing is.. the examples he gave which painted me as ‚Äúcrazy... did not happen. His stories are a combination of extreme exaggerations or outright made up.

I know it shouldn‚Äôt bother me because the things he is saying aren‚Äôt real. But it still hurts. I never call him insane, crazy or psychotic, mostly because I don‚Äôt have to. His behavior speaks for itself.

How do you deal with an ex blatantly lying about you? He and I know a ton of the same people so I‚Äôm a bit nervous as to what other people believe about me now."
"Staying with my parents and have a new place lined up. Just need to nail the no contact now. I'm getting hit with the usual stuff:

- I'll change
- I love you
- How could you just give up on us
- I only verbally abuse you when I'm angry and don't mean what I say
- I would never carry out the physical violence I threaten

Etc, etc, etc. 

It's amazing how much guilt we feel after leaving an abusive relationship, despite being the one who was abused. And it's crazy how we can still love that person, after everything they've done to us."
Im really sad right now thinking about how low ive gone to maintain my relationship and im hoping that ill feel better or gather strength to know im not alone.
"My ex was terrible. His favorite pet names for me were ‚Äúball and chain‚Äù ‚Äúnuisance‚Äù and ‚Äúbitch‚Äù and he told me that it ‚Äúfelt like a chore‚Äù talking to me. When my grandmother died and I was all alone he chose to get blackout at a bar instead of be there for me.
The stories go on and on but there will be no new stories in 2021. In March of this year I was able to find the strength to leave him for good and move on with my life. I am now the happiest I have been in 4 years and my mental health has never been better. This post is for those who are still in the ‚Äúnot ready‚Äù phase. I am here for you and I completely understand what you are going through with zero judgement. Please feel free to reach out."
I have a question for you guys. He has two warrants out. One for domestic assault and the other for unlawful photography. It‚Äôs been over 24 hours. I‚Äôm very anxious about him being found and arrested. I have had the locks changed on my apartment and a security camera set up. How do you keep from being anxious or thinking they are on the run? How long did it take for your person to be found and arrested? I‚Äôm getting anxious and a little scared.
"I know what the healthy answer is. Ignore them. Go no contact. I don't search for their name and when I see them it doesn't send me into a rage, but the emotional side of me wants them to reach out, to respond to my last text telling them I wasn't ok,to spend the time asking how they could fix our friendship and relationship without the looming threat of a cutting remark, dismissal or blame-shifting. Something to show they care about me and aren't quitting.

The likelihood that this won't happen hurts, that I may need to move on without reciprocity or respect, our mutual friends maybe never knowing why I bailed. I have to remember that I am strong and I deserve to be heard. Over and over."
"Same crap for the last fifteen years.

"He talks all sad and wants to get back together. I feel like an idiot for feeling bad for him. He abused me. I know I won‚Äôt get back together with him, since it‚Äôs such a relief to be out, but I‚Äôm still feeling kind of down. I wish I hadn‚Äôt responded to his call."
"In restaurants I‚Äôll get ‚Äòyou talk too loud, everyone can hear us/ everyone is staring‚Äô 
‚ÄòYou always whisper when we are out, I can‚Äôt hear you!‚Äô

When sightseeing:
‚ÄòYou can‚Äôt walk in crowds, you barge in to people‚Äô 
‚ÄòYou walk too slow/fast‚Äô

Anywhere in public: 
‚ÄòDon‚Äôt make those facial expressions it‚Äôs so embarrassing‚Äô
‚ÄòYou look so angry people are gonna think we‚Äôre arguing‚Äô

"I have been dating my boyfriend for 4 years now, and in the past I tend to attract fuck boys.. It's just a fact I guess. Anyways, I have been cheated on, hit, abused, almost everything you can think of, but this man is different. We have been talking about engagement and marriage, and living together for about a year now and just recently started talking about it happening this year. He is a mama's boy and listens to everything that his mom says. He wants to wait till he has money to buy a ring and do things right, but for me and the relationships that I have been in in the past I feel like a ring would be such a good reminder for someone who struggles everyday with anxiety and depression. To be able to look down and remember that I did it and found someone who loves me unconditionally after being treated like garbage I feel like is a huge accomplishment. How do I get him to understand where I am coming from without sounding crazy and continuously asking him when it will happen?"

"Hi. I sought help from a therapist after my rapist started stalking me and a horrifying Title Violation happened in undergrad concerning it which led to me missing 2 quarters of school. When I walked into the session, without knowing me, he said ‚Äúbecause you‚Äôre baaaaaad‚Äù randomly. I have had other incidents like this where I walk into a place and I am emotionally abused, usually involving an incident of privacy invasion or gaslighting. One incident involved the suicide of my friend and was probably the most sadistic. 

I am now terrified of doctors and often strangers."
"Hi. My life and health was pretty much destroyed by 6 years of dating violence followed by my rapist stalking me and invasions of my privacy. He is not in prison, they are still doing it, and none of the financial and health destruction is paid for. There is severe, severe mental and emotional harm.

Lately I am repulsed whenever I see court cases or arrests for other crimes. A lot of anger. Like why are these victims considered more important after the living hell they put me through? I realize not having intervention from law enforcement has really torn down my self worth. I do not understand why laws protecting the community from violence and mental harm are not enforced where I am concerned but other crimes are."

"I got out of an emotionally abusive relationship a couple of months ago. It was 15 months of constant ‚Äúyou‚Äôre worthless‚Äù or ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt even like your personality‚Äù or just public humiliation in front of our so called ‚Äúfriends‚Äù. I knew that it was wrong but I stayed. And now sometimes when I think about it, I think that when I defended myself, I was abusing him. It feels like it‚Äôs all my fault and I was the actual abuser and if I had just stayed quiet he would‚Äôve been better and I wouldn‚Äôt have been called all those names. Is this normal? How do I make it stop?"
"More importantly, if you come to someone with concerns that your relationship is abusive, get out."
"I'm 9 months out and I'm a straight female and the thought of sex repulses me. I can't stand being touched especially by men who think it's fine to be handsy. I'm to the point now where if I never have sex or get into another relationship I'm ok with that. 

I'm concerned that I'm beginning to view all men as the enemy even though I know they're not all like my ex. Maybe I'm just tired of the patriarchy that still exists. Am I alone?"

How did you make it through finally ripping it out?"
I want him to want me back. I want to fall into his arm and be love bombed once again. I want to have the rough sex we had. The trauma bond is so real right now. I crave him even though he is so bad for me...
"Currently writing my statement for a protection order. This sucks and it feels like I'm doing something wrong, or like I did this to myself"
"Step two today getting a job!! My exit plan is coming together, I hope I get this job, It‚Äôs only a cashier job but it‚Äôs more then I have now and I really need this!!! 
I‚Äôm saving up for a vehicle to be more independent and then I can use that to get an additional job and that would help even more!!! 
My anxiety is up!! I have new bruises and new marks on my chest from him. I‚Äôm excited and scared (mixed emotions) My plan looks like it‚Äôs coming together. 
I could use encouragement so I don‚Äôt back out!! Please and thank you, Everyone‚Äôs support is giving me strength!!"
"Everything is really fresh still. And I'm struggling to get out. But the comments my partner made to me last night have really changed my views of him. And I'm ready to move on.

Is it possible for someone who is verbally/emotionally abusive to have actually ever loved you? 
Idk if it would make me feel better or worse to know if he did or didn't. 

Why did it feel like he was helping build me up and make me a better person. And I know now I am a much better person than I was when we first met. Wouldn't someone abusive not do that? I would say I'm a little obsessed with the idea of being good now. Is this part of it? 

Thank you for any comments."
"I know I'm not supposed to gloat, but my N may be taking a turn for the worse. I've been witness to their pattern before, sadly. They start showing more symptoms that objectively look like depression. 

These past months, years, the abuse and their MH issues stay hidden. Last night they had trouble sleeping. Not common. Now they are still in bed many hours past their work time. They seem to have called in sick today. Luckily, I already have some plans to be on errands out.

While I am not happy to see someone suffer, when my N gets to this point they start to see that maybe possibly they have a problem. The multiple additions, anger, anxiety and loneliness don't tip them off.

Hang in there everyone. One day at a time. Some of my days are good and some are bad. I am in control of that (mostly. working on it) and it's OK if today is not one of the ""good"" ones."
"My ex and I had been together for two years. You may have seen the post earlier about me finally breaking it off. I wasn‚Äôt as careful as I should have been and I‚Äôm paying for it dearly. I want to go to the cops but I dont want to for one reason. He has a son with another woman. If I file a restraining order or get him arrested for domestic assault, he will likely never see his son again. I‚Äôm also afraid that he will turn it back on me. I had the guts to hit him back and punch him in his genitals after he ripped my clothes off and took pictures of me. There is a lot more to it. I just need advice."

So basically I have been in a violently abusive relationship for the past 4 years. This man completely believe that women are just supposed to obey the man and not have any say in anything. The only reason I haven t left is because I am scared to leave behind my 9 dogs. I don't have  any place to bring them and don't want them to be in a shelter or to be rehomed. I just want to get stable and bring them back to live with me. Would it be possible to have law enforcement help me get them back safely and without incident? All 9 dogs are legally mine and registered in my name. Would I be able to leave and come back for them in a few months? I am in California if that helps for any sort of technicalities.
we broke up in october but we have been lifelong friends but i don't want to speak to her anymore but i cant bring myself to do anything about it she makes me feel like im crazy for worrying about her when she has all of these self destructive behaviors its almost like she does them to lure me back she is the cause of all my pain and mental afflictions but i love her more than life itself
"I was without a car while I was dating my former abusive bf.  He was a narcissistic abuser, FYI, and a pathological liar.  

 I relied on him often for transportation to work while we were together, especially living together.  

I believe now he used this as one.of his many means of control over me.  

Long story short, last week I put a down payment on my own car.   My first car that I am purchasing by myself, as a woman, without any other financial help from anyone else.  Not even from family (immediate family are also abusive).  

This still doesn't feel real for me, like this car isn't even mind even though I struggled to save.money for 3 months to have a suitable down payment.  I just can't believe it.  

My abuse story is long and complicated, btw,  and I am still healing and struggling with guilt.   If you want to read it, please check my recent post history."

"He apologized to me for fighting after an especially insane week and weekend. Said he wants to get back to what we had before. I told him it was too late, that I would be out before the next weekend (I have had two people offer to let my kids &amp; I stay until the apartment is ready at the first of the month). I can‚Äôt. He is blowing up my phone (Neither one of us are currently home) with messages. They alternate between blame, singing his praises, excuses for his shit behavior, begging me for what I don‚Äôt even know anymore, and trying to guilt me into staying."

"Does anyone have trouble with healthy relationships after being in an abusive one? I‚Äôm interested in your stories. Trouble finding one, trouble feeling things for someone who doesn‚Äôt abuse, being triggered, etc. 

My experience is that my relationships keep getting better but I still don‚Äôt feel like I‚Äôm quite *there* as far as being in a healthy relationship after being in a few abusive ones. I‚Äôm feeling incapable."
"Been a Year Now, still unable to really talk about alot of what happened without becoming confused and emotional. I have my days where I am level and days like today where I quite my job. 

So, I am eating my lunch at a busy gas station and let my family know what is going on. They shrugged it off as ""Ah, you hated that job anyway...they paid you shit wages....it was a temp position....you will find something else......always so smart......I have hard days mentally as well.......Did you do that because of your anxiety thing?"" 

How many times will I quit a job due to my mental illnesses and Trauma before they recognize that my ""Anxiety Thing"" is real and has alot of power on some days.

"My abuser whom I left about a month ago has continued to find new ways to contact me, some of them really creative to try to guilt me into coming back. He just got to me tonight after I didn't hear from him for over a week. It makes me feel horrible and like I'm making the wrong decision by leaving, even though he put me in the hospital three times. I really don't know how to handle this."
"Have you ever started making the escape plan? What do you do when you start getting so anxious to go you don‚Äôt know how to wait another second? It‚Äôs been years of me trying to escape. It never stuck. I want to make sure it does this time. I want to make sure every detail is in place. I‚Äôm terrified and excited all at the same time. I feel like I might combust. I don‚Äôt think he will leave me alone if I stay in this state. A huge part of me wants to be somewhere else, even without him being an issue. I haven‚Äôt figured out how to make the logistics work there without him wondering why I‚Äôm gone. I know this post is kind of all over the place. It‚Äôs been a long four years. It just keeps getting harder to do this. On his nicest days, I still am hurting so bad. He thinks he‚Äôs being funny, and he wonders why can‚Äôt I see that? There‚Äôs so much boiling inside of me, I don‚Äôt even know what to say. Where to start. Someone please say they have been here. That you made it out. please..."
"
Why does it hurt to walk away? After giving everything, and breaking to pieces, why am I insulted with heartbreak? Shouldn‚Äôt it feel good to leave? Shouldn‚Äôt I be excited for my newfound peace? I‚Äôve left a vacancy in my own soul. I‚Äôll occupy bits of memory on his phone, pictures, a couple of old texts maybe, but my seat will be empty. To him I‚Äôm nothing more than a string of distant memories. But I have to bear the scars everyday. He lost me, and  it hurts me more. Even in my absence he inflicts pain."
"I haven't spoken to my ex since early 2018. Part of me is super proud of myself and happy he hasn't tried to reach out. But another part of me is disappointed that I'm still suffering so much. After years of emotional and sexual abuse, it was the best thing for me to cut him out. 

I'm still in therapy. I'm still on antidepressants. My friends can't even touch me without me getting startled. I have to wear a bra at all times or else I don't feel safe. And I've pushed away nearly every chance at romance I've had since then. 

I know trauma doesn't just go away.. but I've been struggling with all this for almost 7 years total. We met in 2014 and it only got worse from then. I guess if anything I wanted to know if anyone had any advice or words of encouragement. Does it get better?"
"I am 18, coming to terms with the fact that, at 16, I was being sexually and emotionally manipulated, coerced, and abused by my boyfriend at the time. I did not believe that this had any impact on the way I view sex, but as I think about it I wonder if it has. I am not sexually repressed, quite the opposite. I have become very sex positive and I don't really consider sex to be meaningful, at all. I give it up too easily, I suppose. But I just don't feel it has any true value to add to my life. I lost my virginity to my abuser and as a result I had no previous conception or perspective on sex. Do you think that the abuse I experienced has impacted my perspective on sex? *Should* sex have meaning?"

"Just got out of an abusive relationship a week and a half ago. I‚Äôm struggling so hard. I moved to Colorado almost a year ago to follow my abusive ex. I have no friends, no home, no hope. Decided today to get dressed up and go out for me and have some dinner and drinks only to find out Denver‚Äôs new covid restrictions. No alcohol sales past 8pm and restaurants only have outdoor seating until 9pm. What great news to my great life. Only had an hour to pick a place and then drive to it if I wanted a drink so wine in bed and crying myself to sleep... just like every night. Doesn‚Äôt seem like it will ever get better. I‚Äôve never been so low. Just needed to vent and some kind words bc I have nothing and no one right now."
"I‚Äôm wondering because I just realised mine did. Or maybe I‚Äôm now realising the risks I take. 

I‚Äôm laying beside my partner right now (it‚Äôs 1:30am) and she‚Äôs been sniffing her nose all day. We‚Äôre sleeping at my place and I‚Äôm scared to tell her to leave (obviously won‚Äôt in the middle of the night).  

I tried to tell her carefully that I‚Äôm a bit concerned, a couple times, but it‚Äôs being laughed off. I‚Äôm told I‚Äôm overreacting and she got angry. I think she should self isolate and get tested. 

My partner knows I‚Äôm high risk. I‚Äôm a 27 y/o AFAB person and relatively healthy but am overweight (gained even more bc of quarantine and severe depression) and am terrified of covid. 

She doesn‚Äôt even seem to care about my life. Oof."
Lmaooooo he‚Äôs a narcissist and I‚Äôm drinking with my best friend right now.. what the fuck do I do lol I‚Äôm so glad he broke up with me and I was laughing about it with my mum but I love him and I think he love bombed me and he‚Äôs a narcissist and a dickhead lol help me
"Before anyone say anything no he never put him hands on me. The abuse that I experienced from him was his need to want to control everything and jealousy. We broke up January. However we were still in contact over the phone and his anger escalated once he realized that yes I really was done. He started calling me obsessively and threatening to pop up on me at work. He called my Supivisor at a lucrative job that I recently gotten and tried to get me fired after knowing all that I was worked for to end up in this position. Now as of late October we have a order of protection. Fast forward to current day we have no contact and I miss him. I‚Äôve always loved him. Though out this entire situation I always had a feeling we would get back together just not right now. I needed time to be away...heal the scares from our previous attempt. There was faults on both sides of the relationship. Toxicity came from both of us. 

So now what? Are these feelings temporary? Fuck."

"So let's say your freshly married. Most things up to this point have been great but then one night you wake up after passing out to find your wife going through your phone. And when she sees that you've waken up starts acting weird. 

So I ask her whats going on and she says ""oh just making sure you arnt doing anything""

And says here you can go through mine. So you do and can clearly see where she has deleted text, almost entire threads gone. 

After this event you lock your phone as you know something isn't right. 

So is this abuse? Controlling at all?"
"Never thought about this before, but I wonder if this is abuse or not.

My parent has taken my tempereture rectally until now, cos this gives most accurate results. Is that weird or abusive? I am 17."
"Has anyone gotten back with their nex after they‚Äôve discarded their nex? What was the result? 

I‚Äôve been wondering whether it always ended with the same cycle happening again, or whether it‚Äôs possible to treat the nex as they did you (does that actually work)?"
Title basically. How can I pretend I still care by someone who forces me to be involved but it isn‚Äôt a safe time to escape?
"I got with my ex when I was 18, he was 22. He was my first real relationship (only went out with one other guy, lasted 3 months or so, never did more than make out). Been together 10 years. We have a child. I only just got out 2 months ago, he denies any abuse. He thinks he's done no wrong. I can't explain what he's done as I'm worried he'll find this account somehow and he'd use it against me to gain full custody of our child somehow. 

How do I know what is normal? How do I stop doubting? Everyone I talk to agrees he's abusive. Everyone tells me it is not normal. But how do I know? How do I avoid getting in another abusive relationship when this one is my template for what relationships look like?"
I wish there was a place where I could vent about my feelings!
""
"I've been with him for almost a year now, at first he would just call me stupid during our fights. He has escalated it to the point where he'll just flat out call me a fucking bitch when something doesn't go his way. He'll scream cunt, whore, retard. Sometimes he will grab me by the face and scream in my ear horrible things and threaten violence.
When everything is going his way he is an amazing person, he swears he has never done this to his past girlfriends and claims that it's who I am that makes him treat me this way. 
I want to leave every time he does it, but when he stops it's like my heart forgets how cruel he's been, and I end up staying. I don't know what to do, I've never cared for someone as much as him, but if he treats me like this does can it even be possible that he cares about me?"
"I stayed with my abuser for 17 years (deep, emotional abuse). We had three kids together. He was never physically violent, until i left and I currently have a restraining order against him. 

My current partner is wonderful in every way except he has a huge blind spot when it comes to this issue. He doesn‚Äôt understand why I stayed so long and blames me for staying for so long. I‚Äôve explained to him the fear, the emotional abuse, the financial abuse, the fear for my children, etc and he still doesn‚Äôt get it. It‚Äôs really hurtful when he blames me for staying so long cause of course deep down no one is harder on me about it than me. 

I try to avoid the topic but sometimes it seems to come up out of nowhere. Mostly brought up by him. I mean it when I say he is a great guy, but this a huge sore spot."
you cannot heal when you stay in the same environment that wounded you.

I used to cry so much over our memories and what we could have been. I mourn this relationship on so many levels that I couldn't hold my tears and finally I reached the level of pure anger and moving on. I cannot take it anymore. The final straw was yesterday when I had my ultimate anxiety attack. My ex just does things with no consideration what so ever. She wants a friendship and I just dont. She also made her mind to go abroad and meet someone else. I am fed up. I feel I am filled with rage and anger for what she had done to me during all the time we were together. I loved her so deeply that its turning bitter and I am so mad. My emotions went through roller coaster and now I just want to live life like she doesn't exist.

"I dont even know where to begin, but I know I am down, depressed, and afraid. I have gotten away from my husband (29m) and have also gotten my daughter (7) also out of the situation. But here I am 10 days later and I am now facing the vicious cycle which my brain/heart are going two different directions. I've left before (several times), but always seem to go back. And he knows this. He has even bragged to people ""oh she'll be back"". I want to 100% break the cycle this time, but I just found out I'm pregnant. I do not want to raise another child alone. Tbh, I'm not even sure i want another child (it was a bc fail not planned at all) But i also dont want to run back. Should I even tell him I'm pregnant? I feel like he will try to reel me back in and it will be ""hook line and sink"" :( I know I can be strong, but how strong is strong???"
"I left my ex and a toxic situation about a month ago, and since then I haven‚Äôt had any peace of mind. She‚Äôs just as cruel and malicious as she is when she‚Äôs drinking. I keep telling her to leave me alone and she goes against my wishes. I‚Äôve said it nicely many, many times and she will not stop. I‚Äôm really getting run down and more depressed. I‚Äôve tried to handle things civilly but she works against it or is extremely disrespectful, and if I don‚Äôt respond, she won‚Äôt stop until I do. It‚Äôs just getting ridiculous. I think she‚Äôs probably stopped therapy, AA, etc. But I just can‚Äôt deal with this. Dealing with a breakup is hard enough, and dealing with this just feels like too much. I know it‚Äôs her trying to get control, but I have never dealt with this before and she is very much not the person I fell for. She won‚Äôt listen to anything if I bring up that I‚Äôm having a hard time with the breakup. I don‚Äôt know I guess I‚Äôm ranting but I‚Äôm just really sad and thought I was free from this."
I cant afford a car so i wouldn't be able to live in a car or drive to work. Which leads to me losing my job. I cant afford to live on my own. If i got paid a few extra dollars i could. I did a monthly budget list and i couldnt do it with my rate right now. I have no friends or family i can just go to. Assistance takes a while but how would i start? Do i tell them im leaving and need help or do i have to be already out and homeless before they can just send me a cheque? I hate this idea as im a hard working woman and i just want to be able to afford a living and be safe. I literally feel trapped right now.
"I don‚Äôt even look at him the same, I love him but I hate him. I want to cheat on him, but I could never do that to anyone. Nobody else could ever want me or love me, but sometimes he acts like he does, and when he does, I just hope it will stay this time if I do everything perfectly right to keep him feeling how he did when he loved me. I want someone to love me, someone to kiss me up and down because he loves me, not because he beat me so badly I was bruised up and down. I want someone to take me on random dates, not take me on a date because yesterday he held a knife to me and threatened to cut me into pieces while wishing for me to die so he could be with somebody else. I‚Äôm just feeling hopeless and I don‚Äôt understand why I‚Äôm not ready to leave even though I know I‚Äôm being abused and I hate him for it."
I‚Äôm not happy with how I‚Äôve been treating myself for far too long.  I‚Äôve pushed myself away and forced myself to forget all of the trauma I‚Äôve experienced. I created a whole alter ego that is the worst version of myself to cope. I‚Äôve been disassociating from my life for the past 2 years. I know this is going to be very hard to come back to myself but it‚Äôs okay I need to heal. I deserve to heal. It‚Äôs about time I do something good for myself. If you‚Äôre not prioritizing what is in the best interest for yourself and your mental health this is a sign. It‚Äôs time to step up and be there for yourself.
"I've posted before about his episodes but how I really know I have to get out. He spent all evening taunting me telling how he would kill me and what he would do with my body and telling me I was stupid not to leave while I had the chance but the the thing is I'm stuck in a foreign country with him, with no money and nowhere to really go. I dont even really have a home to go back to. He gambled and snorted all my savings away a long time ago and I have absolutely no idea how to get away from this now. I don't think there are any shelters here (small island) and if there were I wouldn't have the language skills to access them. I guess I'm not asking anything, just venting here."
"The last time we talked I was crying to him asking him to explain to me why I deserved to be treated the way I was treated and he threatened to come to my apartment and kill me or beat the shit out of me. Hes threatened to kill my 3x and once when I fucked up his friend posted something online that was threatening. 

I've been asking for my belongings back for literally months with no success. Basically the title explains my question, should I ask the police to be there when he drops it off? They want me to make a statement about him because once I called them when I was afraid, but I've been reluctant because he has a criminal history and he might go to jail. We live in a small town and everyone would hate me (more than they already do, for ""ruining"" his life)."
"Has anyone had EMDR for instances of abuse/ infidelity that you have experienced in abusive relationship and had positive results whilst you're still being abused by the person?

"He finally went and asked for help last week. He told the therapist a bit of everything, including psychological domestic violence. She gave him antidepressants and other pills for his ocpd / anxiety. He's been so lovable! He's been caring, motivated with me and with himself I almost can't believe it!

But now I have no idea what to do! Sometimes I react with him like he's done something bad to me but I know it's just the habit or trauma. I want to help him and myself in this stage, but this is a whole new level, I'm afraid I'll ruin something =/"

Men just name call me and push me down steps. I want to be loved and appreciated."
"This was told to me tonight by a family member about my stepdad after continual emotional and sometimes physical abuse. At this point to me, that‚Äôs bulls***. I can‚Äôt even think about forgiveness because the hurt is still so bad. I don‚Äôt know what to do. 

He unexpectedly showed up tonight, and drove 4 hours, to get my sister and mom and I to talk to him again. My Mom and Sister are complying. I‚Äôm not. I told them that if he stays for thanksgiving tomorrow I will not be here. They find this totally unreasonable. 

I‚Äôve been crying for hours and I‚Äôm just so emotionally drained. I‚Äôm just not in a place to forgive right now after all the hurt and no one in my family is understanding why I‚Äôm acting or feeling this way. 

There‚Äôs also some things that have happened with him that I don‚Äôt feel comfortable telling them that they don‚Äôt know about, so that could be part of the reason they think this. But I really need some advice, validation, anything...I‚Äôm feeling so broken right now."

"Many years ago I believe I was love bombed.

I had never felt such an intense relationship before.  She was seducing me to leave my wife.  I almost did.

It fell apart rapidly, but the feeling that someone knew my vulnerabilities and loved me for them never left.

Recently this woman‚Äôs relatives were connected to a dangerous cult.  I know my friend was never part of the cult.  

But the cult story scared me, really badly.  I‚Äôm still not thinking clearly about it.

It brought up memories of this ‚Äúthing‚Äù she and I had.

Here I am 5 years later, having a hard time in relationships. I‚Äôm scared of anything becoming serious and tend to push myself away.

I‚Äôve tried so so so so many times to leave him, I‚Äôve even left him for 4 weeks and still gone back. 

He has broken up with me now due to him smashing up my apartment and he said it was my fault and he can‚Äôt be with someone who makes him do those things, so I‚Äôm at a friends house but I just know this isn‚Äôt the end, because I‚Äôm not strong enough and so in denial about the abuse. He‚Äôs hit me so many times, I had a black eye for over 3 weeks two times and couldn‚Äôt see anyone, he‚Äôs wrecked my mouth, he‚Äôs smashed everything I own and I still love him like what sort of person am I to love that"
I know contacting them will bring nothing but pain.. I can deal with it and want to cry..please anyone that has a history of dealing with abusive or narcissistic relationships please feel free to message me thanks.

Today he got angry because of the type of panties i went to work with. I put on a thong because i didnt have anything else clean
So I am in a very small town and have no family and no friends I am completely isolated. No I‚Äôm not being a victim. He has been charged with assault and breaking protection order. So I let him have sex with me rarely but it happens and I say after cause he says I look sad and I said yes this is my purpose for you. Then I do the washing wait around for him to have a lunch break and make lunch. Then it breaks my heart and makes me feel stupid Because I know I deserve better than this and I have to realise this is what I have. My brother killed himself last year 39 and ten years ago my dad did it is so hard I was angry at first but I understand they were tired.  I have Daughters one at college at he other high school I don‚Äôt see them but I would never want the burden or invalidity of purpose to be on them or is so hard
"I just feel like I deserve this but basically I think things have escalated and they're trying to push my boundaries and threatening to post bodychecks (photos with a lot of skin) if I don't do their ""work/help"" and I honestly think having them as a resource is helpful when I'm deeply self hating I'm just scared right now and I don't know what to do

Also an ana coach is basically someone who bullies you into not eating/doing eating disorder behaviors"
I created a new account just to post on here. I found out the ex‚Äôs new gf overdosed and is on life support. I found this out because my 7 year old told me about his dad calling 911 and police being at his apartment so I asked him. He‚Äôs really weird about whether the OD was intentional or accidental. He‚Äôs also moving out and having her family pick up her belongings this weekend. I notified my kiddos school and they are getting child protective services involved. I don‚Äôt even know what to do anymore. Kind words and advice are welcome.
"I feel as though I am done with my relationship. I was physically abused last year. I was choked, slammed, pushed, and shoved around for 3 hours. I thought I wasn‚Äôt going to make it. My kids watched all of this. I went back a few months later, things were okay and then things would not be okay for a week or a few days. I would just want to run away when things were bad. I always felt like the problem and maybe I was the one that was putting the other through abuse. I try to end things and it‚Äôs like he knows just what to say to keep me around. He says just what I want to hear. I have left twice since then and have just gone back. It sucks that this person can make you sooo happy but also sooo stressed at the same time. He says my anxiety and panic attacks are too negative and for no reason. I have nothing to fear. I just don‚Äôt believe it anymore. I just can‚Äôt end this relationship. I am just venting and letting things out. Someone please give me advice I am losing myself."

"So in my relationship I knew things weren‚Äôt right. But I mostly thought it was myself. Because of the dynamic of the relationship.

Is it normal to fight for your relationship when it ends. But then suddenly be like wait what just happened? It makes me feel like I‚Äôm just trying to cushion the blow and blame abuse.

There are some really good moments but there are scary ones too. I know I shouldn‚Äôt have been spoken to this way. He never laid a hand. 

I have no idea if I‚Äôm being reliable in my narrative when I barely understand this story. So how could I be good and cheery then although HIGHLY ANXIOUS. but still maintaining a normal ish composure some days at work

To completely crumbling and snapping and becoming a mess of panic attacks and fear after?"

"i don‚Äôt feel i‚Äôm a bad person
but i always doubt myself for what happened
i‚Äôd get angry and call him a cunt
i‚Äôd look at his phone
i‚Äôd make him send his location

he lied a lot and he cheated and he would say nasty things so i feel that the way i acted was in reaction. and i know it wasn‚Äôt right but i couldn‚Äôt leave him. he knew the right things to say when i told him i couldn‚Äôt do it anymore

i know he was abusive, i‚Äôm in therapy my therapist told me and many people have told me this but i just doubt myself so much and it find it hard

he told everyone after we broke up i was crazy and psycho and some of the things i did was like it‚Äôs not right looking through someone‚Äôs phone and i know that

i feel like it means i don‚Äôt have the right to complain and feel damaged about being abused

does anyone else feel like this?? is it normal? am i just that doubtful of myself or am i just not a good person"
"I just found out that he hired my attorney before I could because I didn‚Äôt have the money together yet. 

I still can‚Äôt afford a lawyer. 

She‚Äôs pushing for mediation and 50% custody. 

Nobody takes me seriously because he hasn‚Äôt physically hit me yet. 

I feel defeated. The law is supposed to protect me and yet his money won him our son to use to continue to exert power and use to control me."
"I'm really sad that everyone around me has family to spend the holidays with. 

But I am focusing on the positives

I'm in a safe place. 
I have my daughter whom is my bestest friend.
We can start our own traditions.
This is my fresh start. 
I'm not being abused and my daughter wont see me being abused. 

I hope everyone is having a lovely day and will have a great holiday. I am doing the best I can in the shelter and my goal is to get a place for my daughter and I. I will stay strong for her. üôÇ"

"I'm really fucking pissed and I need to vent. My brother occasionally kicks me, hits me, and scratches me and when I retaliate in self defense, he hits back harder. He left a bloody scratch along with two other mild scratches and I want it to stop. My mom tells him not to and when I confront to her about it not working, she says ""its the best I can do"". I want it to fucking stop I don't know what to do. Please help..."

The abusers voice began to fade And you could hear your own voice and sense your own desires ?

"I'm a little annoyed with myself. I feel totally detached. 

I really wish they had been the person I thought they were. I loved having a beautiful person to lay down next to every night. I miss the warmth at night. I miss the feeling of a real close hug when things are hard. 

I'm annoyed because before I met them, it just didnt bother me. I was happy with my life. Populated by friends. I have a beautiful cat. But now I find it hard to sleep in the home I spent so much times screaming in. God I just want a warm body to sleep next to, someone I trust. But you cant just have that one part of someone. I'm too scared to trust someone for who they are anymore."
"So I've been free from my abusive relationship for about 4 months now. I've started dating but not really looking for something super serious right away, it would take me time to get to know someone before committing to anything.

Anyway, past relationships usually come up at some point during the first couple dates, and I usually don't go into any detail regarding what happened in my most recent relationship.

However, I feel like if I things progress and I start to get strong feelings for someone, then they will probably need to know about this as it's likely that this will affect me in ways I don't know yet.

But I also don't want to tell people too early incase it is a red flag for them with me over sharing so early.

So, at what point do you usually tell a potential partner about your past relationship trauma? (If at all.) Thanks!"
"It has been about 6 months since I ended things with my ex partner. Our relationship was fairly nice the first 2 years until I moved in with him. Although, he was smothering and annoying at times, things were not ever too bad. Once I moved in, is when the chain and the masks started to come off. My partner was still nice, and did sweet things for me, but the gaslighting and emotional abuse came about. He told me at the end of our relationship that he started feeding this monster in his head that I would never leave him, dont know why he would acknowledge that, maybe so I would forgive him. I am aware of all the bad things, the betrayal and trust loss and when I go to places, I feel scared I will see him or feel bad doing things as I started feeling like his property at a certain point. But sometimes I will just get bombarded with good memories, and feel really bad. Like we were working towards our home or the sweet things he would do. How do you cope during these times?"

I‚Äôm done being pushed away every day. I just want to be the one who ends a conversation for once. I didn‚Äôt want to end it cause I still have stuff I want to talk about.

"I have one son with my abuser. I cannot seem to let go of the fantasy that we could have had it all - and been a happy, healthy family. I hold on to the thought of how he was when we first met. The man he led me to believe he was. 

The abuse got very, very bad. Physically, emotionally, and verbally. He controlled my every move, and punished me for things out of my control or that I had nothing to do with. Yet all I seem to be able to reminisce on is the good. 

When I see happy, growing families - I am jealous. I wanted that. I wanted that so badly for us. 

But it wasn‚Äôt us. And it‚Äôll never be us. I just can‚Äôt seem to accept it.. I crave it so badly. 

Just needed to vent."
"I feel like I took the meanness of my ex out on other people and I feel disgusted with myself over it. He made me feel so insecure and useless that I took it out on others. Usually, this wasn't to anyone's face, but I would sit and nitpick about everyone in my own head, and think of all their flaws and weaknesses. It didn't even make me feel better about myself necessarily, I just felt like I was stuck in such a negative mindset. There are also a few times I remember, especially after getting in fights with my ex, that I would go on my phone afterwards to try and distract myself and if some minor shit  I saw pissed me off, I would just go off on undeserving strangers. I don't want  to be the kind of person who does that. I don't want to be a bully. I just don't know how to feel better for what I did. We've been separated for about three months now and I already feel much less negativity, but I still feel a lot of guilt."
"How do you deal with it? I know that if I leave him he'll endlessly badmouth me to our child.. I can't see him not having a negative impact on our little one, unless I cut all contact. But the little one adores their dad and I'm terrified of a custody battle. LO is only a few months old at present, so I have some time to think, I just don't know what to do or where to start. Abuse is verbal... at the moment ‚òπÔ∏è

Any advice or stories much appreciated."
"It was something like:

When he first raised his voice at me, I realised it was due to his stress at work and that I had been asking bad questions.

Then when he first hit me, it was not intentional and he just couldn't control himself.

Etc

When I left the note on the flowers on her tombstone I just wish she had left him when he first raised his voice.

Or something like that. Got a good friend who is in a violent relationship and making excuses for his behaviour. That meme would help."
"Was it worth it? Did it help at all? I'm afraid it's just going to set them off and I'm trying to weigh my options. Looking for some insight and real life outcomes. 

I've already tried a stay away order and it did nothing. He creates new email addresses by the dozens and new accounts and is constantly harassing me. It's been nearly a year with no let up. I feel like I've tried everything emotionally and I'm exhausted."
"Hey guy‚Äôs, so im like half a year after the relationship and into my healing phase, and i started to lose interest in my old tv shows i liked and new ones, because i hate how the characters behave and how they normalize abusive behavior.

Lets say ‚ÄúHow i met your mother‚Äù or ‚ÄúThe big bang theory‚Äù -
There‚Äôs a couple and the girl is like ‚Äúim a beautiful and you are nerd/ugly guy, you‚Äôre lucky to have me‚Äù etc..

And i know it‚Äôs comedy and all but it just reminds me stuff about my relationship and how those stuff are really not ok and it‚Äôs pretty much abusive.

Maybe it‚Äôs just me, Am i just paranoid or something?
Or it really is that my beloved tv shows are showing abusive behavior.."
"So, the physically abusive incident was that she was packing her bfs bags after a fight because she wanted him to leave, but he pushed her away from his bag. 

So. Pushing, pulling and shoving is where physical abuse starts (from my experience anyway) . And I have spoken to him about the incident and to her but they think their love is special and stronger than any.... They dont listen to me and they have that ""we're gonna make it one day baby"" attitude....

He is also a ""recovering"" drug addict (for khat which is similar to meth) but they smoke ALOT of weed together

Is there anything I can do or nothing....?"
"(21F) broke it off last winter. Took me till 2 months ago, but I actually like someone again. I want to date him and am 99% sure he's genuinely a good person, but I'm still scared of being hurt like I was last time. I'm scared of even holding hands. How do you learn to trust a s/o? How do you not get flashbacks while with your new s/o?"
"Please
He just slapped me because I asked him to fix his second phone instead of playing video games on my phone. Today he playedfor 12 hours and he is not done. He is obsessed with it and because of it I'm stuck staring at nothing all day and hear him talking about the game and it has became a problem. He gets mad/ doesnt sleep/spend a lot of money on it.
He doenst let me work, I dont have a single penny. I can go to my grandma's house and I secretly reconnected with a friend who is willing to help. The thing is, he never leaves the apartment.It's not safe to leave in front of him and the recent lockdown has resulted in me being locked with him 24/7. But this time I'mdone. Help me, how can I leave? I cant afford leaving all my clothes behind but I have been thinking of it. I cant justwait forthe lockdown to be over, it could take months. I cant take another second."
"I'm really reflecting on my past experiences, one thing that comes up constantly from is how I kept on hearing the same stories over and over again, especially stories about him. Whenever I hear him say ""I. . ."" I cringe.

"Finally moved out of my flat I shared with my ex but we ended up as friends towards the end as broke up back in May. It was a toxic relationship, we weren‚Äôt right for each other but were together 5 years. He was manipulative and abusive (I think I may have been a bit too). I have been on the verge of what feels like a breakdown all day and I can‚Äôt stop crying. Have moved into new flat with a few girls (I don‚Äôt know) and even semi cried in front of them. Help. It hurts so much even though we both know it‚Äôs right and for the best. We had such a sad, emotional, teary goodbye and it was just horrible. What can I do to make the pain ease off? We were never apart for more than a week and I just don‚Äôt know what to do now, I feel so lost and alone and I‚Äôm struggling."
"I'm 17 and my gf is 16.  We are long distance and fell in love before I truly knew just how bad her family was.  They manipulate her every day and constantly verbally assault her to the point she becomes depressed and filled with anxiety.  She has hinted at suicide attempts in the past and beatings, but has not outright said it.

She made a minor impulsive mistake yesterday and they took her phone over it.  They looked through it and found all her private conversations, deep secrets, everything.  She is in so much hot water right now.  She is safe, but I don't know what's going on over there.

I'm not entirely sure what to do.  I don't want her to live through two more years of this but I don't have a clue on what I should do.  Do we just wait it out, call CPS, convince her parents to have her moved to a relative?

I'm lost.  I've never had to deal with something like this."
"mannn, i just want to let this MF GOOOO. we‚Äôve been on and off for two years. we‚Äôve gotten nowhere. with every ounce of my soul, body, and mind I KNOWW he is bad for me.

"I am at my last straw so I don‚Äôt know where else to turn and I‚Äôm sorry if I mess up any rules or anything but I don‚Äôt know where else to go. I don‚Äôt want to explain the details of what happened on a public post to protect my safety but my husband was physically violent with me today. There are many details that make me confused about the situation but I believe he may have been gaslighting me for quite awhile. 

Idk if this is a weird request but I need somebody to PM me because I can‚Äôt post about the situation publicly and I feel so lost and don‚Äôt even know what is true or not anymore. It does involve graphic violence and threatening suicide so I wanted to put a tw for that. But I have very little people to talk to and I won‚Äôt see my therapist again until next month. I just need some support to know that I‚Äôm not totally losing my mind here."
"I left my ex boyfriend who was emotional abusive just a few months ago. He knew I am still vulnerable and decided it would be a great time to text me under a different phone number. He offered to go on a ‚Äúroad trip‚Äù across the country as friends. Said he trusted me, and thought I was desensitized already to everything. It made me furious because he knew if I accepted the trip I would be under his control again. I profusely told him no and it would not be happening and we need to go out separate ways but he tried to paint me as the bad guy. The road trip wouldn‚Äôt be fun without me, exes can be friends, why im making it such a big deal, etc."

"If you were in conflict this would not be a normal or acceptable reaction. But I find myself smiling in conflict with my partner.

For some time now my safety and peace of mind have been compromised at home. As my daughter approaches 2 I worry for what she will have to witness or endure given the toxicity of our relationship.. BD is extremely aggressive when he‚Äôs angry and uses any leverage he has against you. What are my options? I recently began working and am working towards being self sufficient again..

When do you stop missing them despite knowing every fucked up thing they‚Äôve done to you? I know he‚Äôs never going to be any good for me and all of our bad times always outweighed the good and I try to remember that and remind myself why he no longer needs to be apart of my life but some days are harder than others and it‚Äôs been getting harder and harder to cope recently. When does it stop? How do you deal with it? Trauma bonding is very real and it physically hurts everyday.

"A friend posted in defense of Johnny Depp. I posted a reasonable, evidence based opinion that he's not the primary victim of that relationship, while acknowledging that Amber Heard was also toxic and abusive. 

Regardless of whether or not I'm wrong, they made a point to be performative about needing to stand up for male victims. When I clearly told them that I'm a male victim and that I'm in part basing my thoughts on Depp's behavior compared with abuse I've endured, I was accused of ""internalizing my toxic masculinity"" and ""weaponizing my abuse to deny another victim"". 

My abuse is ignored and written off and I'm told that I'm toxic, by people who are claiming to stand up for abused men. 

I feel like shit."

Am I the one who is in the wrong for thinking I shouldn't be in a controlling relationship? Like recently we had an argument and off topic I mentioned going on a night out with work staff, her reply was you have no friends and if you give me a reason why I should go on a night out then I can go

6 months later, she accused me of being unfaithful during an argument (wasn‚Äôt the first time and was completely unfounded and hurtful) and moved out without us having a discussion. She shared cryptic things online that made me out to be an abusive cheater, and 2 months after the breakup, she was with someone else (we dated for 1.5 years and she ended it, oddly enough).

The great thing is, I really didn‚Äôt have much of a reaction at all to seeing the memory. If anything, I found it comical. So folks, pay attention to their actions, not their words. Anyone can say certain things; pay attention to behaviors.

"I've been in an abusive relationship with my husband for 15 years and for the past 15 years I have been making empty threats to leave. This summer I finally broke and asked for a divorce. I guess that ""woke him up"". He stopped drinking, joined AA, got counciling, and apologized/admitted to the abuse.  Because of these real steps hes taking, I've decided to stay. But now I utterly hate myself. I feel like I'm doing my past self an injustice.  Im constantly on edge waiting for the backslide, because 15 years of the same behavior tells me to expect one. He tells me he needs time to prove to me the change is real, and I really hope it is (for his and our children's sake). I don't know if I will ever be able to trust him again, even if the change is real. How long will I hate myself?"

"I didn‚Äôt want to admit it. I really wanted to believe the best in this person and that they cared. 

But they abused me. 

I asked them to show accountability for their behavior (stonewalling, gaslighting, ghosting cycles), and they simply did it again.

I let them get close to me and I trusted them.

I had an abusive relationship in the past with a friend before this, and they manipulated my trust and tried to get me to open up to them, and subsequently abused me. I suffered trauma from that relationship, but ultimately healed from it.

Here I am, realizing I was abused by someone I trusted, again. I told myself, and I promised myself, so much that I never ever want to be in abusive relationships, friendship or otherwise. I unfortunately, feel weak right now. I hate this. 

I don‚Äôt know what to say."
"I am triggered by my abuser, who I misbelieved was a good person...but had put me through a stonewalling/ghosting/gaslighting abuse cycle. 

I am now at a place where I asked them for accountability, but instead they have stonewalled me for the longest period ever. 

I am not getting PTSD/panic attacks, especially because I have an transgenerational history of narc abuse...

I don‚Äôt know what to do and quarantine makes it worse.."
"Anyone else unsure of what memories are true and what aren‚Äôt because of their SO/ Ex‚Äôs ability to be so damn good at gaslighting or manipulation? And if so, how did you handle it?"
Every time we argue it happens and I know it‚Äôs going to but it doesn‚Äôt hurt any less. The police get called every time he‚Äôs violent. So instead he‚Äôs resorting to verbal he knows it hurts me the most it‚Äôs why he says it. ‚ÄúYoure a fat rapist whore‚Äù he says. ‚ÄúYou were never raped. You have a victim complex. You‚Äôre a typical women.‚Äù I tell him to stop I beg him to stop. He doesn‚Äôt understand the word. He likes the word. It makes him want to do it more.

"And it just feels good to tell people my story because I hid it for so long. We have been married for about 3 years, together for 7. We have young children together. The relationship started as verbally and physically abusive almost from the very beginning. It was very toxic. From giving birth with a black eye, to blacking out, feeling like I was almost dying from strangulation, concussions, etc, it saddens me that I put up with that for so long. It took me about 2 months of planning my escape and saving up money, but one day when he went to work, I packed up my kids and our most important items with the help of a friend and moved into my own apartment an hour away. The last time he strangled me in front of our kids was my breaking point and I decided I did not have not even one more fight in me after that."

From giving birth with a black eye, to blacking out, feeling like I was almost dying from strangulation, concussions, etc, it saddens me that I put up with that for so long. It took me about 2 months of planning my escape and saving up money, but one day when he went to work, I packed up my kids and our most important items with the help of a friend and moved into my own apartment an hour away. The last time he strangled me in front of our kids was my breaking point and I decided I did not have not even one more fight in me after that."
"FFS, im sick of it. I enjoy the angry moments because I feel powerful in myself, like I can set healthy boundaries. But when the anger fades, it always brings sadness. 

I loved him. A whole whole lot. And I think there was a part of him that loved me. But he isn't capable of loving the way I need. I didnt ask for much. And yeah, I have things to sort out as well. Relationships involve two people and I took on all of the responsibility. 

Anyway, I just wish I could forget how aligned with myself I was when we had good moments. I wish it was easier to imagine being this open again. But its not. Its hard as hell and sometimes it just makes me sad."

I am absolutely terrified.. I have left my narcissist boyfriend many times but I am finally doing something final about it. I know this is what I need to do but I am so scared
"Is anyone else dealing with this?

The people in my abusive spouse‚Äôs life and around him don‚Äôt know what‚Äôs going on, with him or with us. 

And so, they have decided to people who, where they have picked up on that something is very wrong, instead of showing basic humanity and compassion, have made it clear they have vilified me in the narrative they‚Äôve created for themselves. 

While I‚Äôm here, trying to love him and build a life with and stand by and take care of their son, brother and friend.

Who is fucking abusive to me.

For what then? Why am I even here doing that?

This is breaking me down. 

Fuck."

Hey guys I feel like i want to share my story on youtube because I feel like it will help alot of people. But I'm afraid it will ruin my abusers life even if I don't use his real name. Can he sue me for doing this? Do you think this is a good idea?

It kinda sucks when your abusive ex is so outgoing that everyone loves them but you're not petty enough to tell them all the truth.
"I got out of my emotionally abusive with my nex this summer. His ex wife had warned me about his behavior a couple years ago, but obviously I was already manipulated to believe that she was the ""crazy one"". I feel so much guilt, and in general feel so stupid that I continued the relationship. I just wanted to tell her that she was right.
 
During college I was cheated on by my college bf with another girl. A year later she sent me an email apologizing and although it didn't change anything, it gave me some closure. These experiences aren't the same but that's where my head is at right now."
"I already feel the weight lifting. It will be a few weeks but I've applied for a studio, been accepted and am planning the move. He knows. But he's rarely lucid so hoping this can go smoothly. I know the time leading up to leaving can be the most dangerous. Fortunately, I guess, the abuse is mainly emotional so I'm not really concerned about physical violence. Fingers crossed. I do have to be tactical and I'm making meticulous plans. Things he may not notice at first... Also, he travels a lot for work so I have chunks of time to operate alone. I thought I was stuck. What really helped was finally getting over the embarrassment of the situation and telling people who truly care about me what's going on. I have next to no local friends so it required some reach out but I got the clarity and help I needed to find a way out. Also, many thanks to this community for helping me understand I'm not alone and this treatment is not okay. There is hope"
"**just following up from my last post** 
High stake events or conversations always get my BD riled up and it‚Äôs hard to always satisfy conversation with him. I always say something he finds dumb or annoying, something that always makes him wonder about my upbringing or the quality of people I surround myself with etc. So tired of always being questioned on my intelligence or for my methodology as if I‚Äôm dumb or useless. Then having that come into question whether I‚Äôm a competent enough mom to raise my daughter around. Sometimes I wish I chose someone less smart maybe even more complacent to be with so I could be valued more or better. Why does he want me to think so low about myself? It doesn‚Äôt encourage me to want to be better or different, just further depresses me."

My sister is crazy. She has TRIED to rape me. She forgets that I work out and that she is 70 pounds MAX, she is 16 btw. She has chased me around the house with knives. She says ¬®It was a jooooooke¬® It was not a joke. She has thrown books at my younger siblings, 5 and 2. TRIED to attack my mom while she was 8 months pregnant with my now 2 yr old sister. She has attempted to get my step father arrested for molesting her. (He didn't) Please dont @ me for this, he just didnt. Wanna know what would have happened if he had gotten arrested? We would have moved back to my moms ghetto ass home town in a ghetto ass trailer. My mom cant afford these bills. She is just plain evil. She has tried to beat me up. Once again, I work out, she is 70 pounds MAX."

Title speaks for itself. I really need help
I shared my ambivalence during couples s therapy and he disclosed that he was questioning his sexuality and while he was attracted to women he was not attracted to me. He somehow felt the option of me staying pregnant while he explored his sexuality was a viable one. I chose to terminate the pregnancy. Prioritizing my mental health and my sons emotional well-being. I later found out he had experimented with men in the past and never shared that. He now denies everything. I hate him.

"Can confident and happy people get together with an abuser? I was in a very abusive relationship. He manipulated me and cheated on me multiple times and also cheated on me with his now girlfriend. She seems like a confident and ""overly happy"" person.
I started to question myself and blame myself for being too weak and sensitive and for having depression and thinking that's why he treated me so bad. 
Is it possible that my abusive ex will treat his new girlfriend differently, just because she seems ""stronger"" and more compatible and she gets along with his friends and environment better than me? I even contacted his former fiance because I was so desperate and needed to talk and she basically had the same experience as me although she also seems like a very serious and ""strong willed"" person. Does it even matter what kind of personality the abuser's new girlfriend has? Does it have any influence on the severeness of the abuse? Maybe I triggered him the most? I am really confused."
"I don‚Äôt know what to say.
The next day he gaslit me and told me that it‚Äôs okay for ‚Äúsmall stuff‚Äù and he doesn‚Äôt have a ‚Äúproblem‚Äù."
Yesterday my significant other got really drunk and said something mean that made me cry. Apparently I was to loud so he kept telling me to stop crying and to stfu but I couldn‚Äôt and the more he said stuff the more I would cry. Eventually he got so scared his parents were gonna walk in he held me to the bed and covered my mouth and nose. He said he didn‚Äôt mean to cover my nose but he wouldn‚Äôt let go. Later that night he tried to fight his dad and me and his family had to hold him and his dad back. At one point idk if he elbowed me or hit me or what but my head swung back and I had a bloody nose. Everyone kinda played it off and gave me a wet towel and didn‚Äôt really say anything else about it. Is this abuse or was he just to drunk?

"Hey Reddit,

 I (19F) am a SA survivor and currently dealing with the sex trauma that a previous abusive relationship has given me. It seems like my shame has physically manifested in my body, recently I've started developing very intense migraines as well as chronic pain in specific areas where I was frequently touched by my abuser. I just physically feel very tense all of the time and it seems like while my mind is healing, my body refuses to do the same. I'm scared of what this may mean. 

I'm just wondering if anyone has any advice on treating this? I've found a lot of somatic exercises very helpful and I'm currently working with a therapist. I'd appreciate any help or guidance!"
"First of all, hello everyone. I hope you are doing fine. 

I M(29) gave my now ex F(24) chance after chance for something that should have been a deal breaker from the first time it happened. Positive is that it has only been a bit over a year and I should be glad this happened earlier rather than later. 

I don't really have a story to tell, but I feel like by writing this down I can assure myself that I won't give her a chance again. She will contact me again later this week, as usual, to apologize and say she'll do better; but she won't. If anything she has become complacent with me forgiving her and letting her back in. 

I'm tired of being hurt by her and this is the last time. Next steps are therapy for me."
"I spent all of this morning conflicted over wether I should send a message or not. I didn‚Äôt. I wanted to bring up every time she‚Äôd attacked me, humiliated me; every time she‚Äôd just push the boundary a little further so that it would be worse the next time. I wanted to ask why even though I know the answer, it‚Äôs nearly been a year and finally I can say out loud: she‚Äôs a psychopath.

It‚Äôs taken so long but I‚Äôve finally stopped making any excuses for her, I‚Äôve stopped defending her and most importantly I‚Äôve stopped blaming myself. I didn‚Äôt deserve that, no one does.

Seeing the Amber Heard and Johnny Depp headline today made me spiral. I fell into a rabbit hole reading the accusations of both sides and I put my phone down not knowing who to believe. The things he‚Äôs accused her of strike so close to home for me. I feel confused again, I haven‚Äôt been for awhile. Anyway I just needed to vent, thank you."

When I first got with my ex I gave him so much affection I loved him so much but the more verbally abusive he got the more I stopped giving him affection before I left i didn‚Äôt want to even be touched by him and I hated affection. Now I struggle receiving affection even from my mom. I don‚Äôt want to be this way but I don‚Äôt know why it bothers me so much. Has anyone else felt this way?
"I‚Äôm with someone wonderful now but lately I have been feeling this tug at my heart for my abusive ex. 

The last time he reached out to me to try to get back together I effectively told him to fuck off. He told me that he was sorry for hurting me and that he‚Äôd be ‚Äúwaiting for‚Äù me. I have done a lot to burn every bridge connecting us but today I find myself wishing I hadn‚Äôt.

I‚Äôm just going to say it: I miss him. I wish I gave him another chance. I‚Äôve never felt attraction as strong as I was when I was with him. I never got closure and there was so much wish unsaid. I wish things went differently. I wonder often if he is still waiting for me. And I guess a small part of me still loves him deeply.

I don‚Äôt know if I‚Äôm looking to get this off my chest, or to look for validation, or to look for someone to tell me not to return for him. But any response is welcome, I feel so alone and hate myself for feeling this way about him."
Is anyone down for making a chatroom to support each other and help people who are still going through the abuse and want to get out or people who are still recovering?
" \[TL:DR\] Abusive ex will not stop online stalking and harassing me after we broke up many months ago. Will legal action spark a narcissist's fire and set off other attacks, or silence the perpetrator?

I have gotten out of an abusive relationship and as the title states I am a victim of online stalking and harassment. I have considered legal action, but have not gone so far as I thought it is ""not that bad"" or it might stop at some point. Unfortunately it is not stopping and people close to me are saying I should take legal action. As my ex is a picture book narcissist I am thinking through the option that a legal action will somehow set of other types of attacks, maybe even legal ones just to fight and engage with me.

Has anyone successfully got the abusive ex to stop online stalking and harassment by legal action? Is there anything else I should consider?"

"I've been out for a little over two weeks. I have to keep going back to the house so I can see and spend time with the kids, and when my abusive wife sees me, she's so nice. I know what she did to me, even though she denies it. It hurt me so much. But I'm so lonely and isolated that I'm desperate for any contact. She's the only person I can actually count on for affection, even if it is abusive. Logically, I know I need to stay away from the relationship. But part of me wants to go back, just because it's normal and comfortable--even if it's hell. I don't have anyone to talk to, which only makes it worse. Does the loneliness and isolation ever get any better? I can't handle it."

Don't get back out into the dating pool right away. 
Stick with friends and those who love you. Build yourself up. Have fun. Spoil yourself. Go shopping, go to dinner, see a movie, take a long walk in the park. 
 It gets better. Take your time, do not rush your healing.   And, when you're ready to get back out there you will know your true worth. Love yourself first. Put your needs at the top of your list always. 

There's someone out there ready to love and cherish you like you've never had before. Make this life count, you deserve so much better."
"So when I ended things with my ex, it was nasty. While yelling at me, he asked me what did I want from him. I said that I wish that he never abused me and would maybe offer a really apology one day. He told me that my personality dictates how people treat me thus blaming me for his abusive behavior towards me. He tried to imply that he wouldn‚Äôt abuse the right woman. 

As much as I know there is no excuse to be treated that way, I wonder if it is my fault. Am
I too weak? Will he treat someone better?"
"I've posted in here before, &amp; it's always helpful

Doesnt make her feel bad for liking things, doesnt make her feel bad about herself. He still talks to me &amp; berates me like we are still together. I feel like I wasnt good enough for him to treat me right but she is. He seems nicer with her, but he drinks a lot now, has admitted driving drunk, had admitted he drinks more than usual. 

I just dont like myself right now, I dont think I was worth any effort the 6 years we were together but this girl of 3 months is worth more than I was

"Saw a meme today that said something along the lines of ‚ÄúThe wrong person makes you beg for attention, affection, love, and commitment. The right person gives you these because they love you.‚Äù

I‚Äôm not sure how I feel about this. I would say it triggers me a bit.. my ex always said I didn‚Äôt give her enough attention/affection. We were together 95% of the time and I tried being the best partner I could be. I attempted making changes when she stated her needs (my ex was manipulative and accused me of being unfaithful ‚Äî check out my previous posts). 

My question is: how do you know when if this demand for more attention is part of your partners manipulation or if it‚Äôs genuine? I‚Äôve been beating myself up for the longest time, and although I thought I was a good partner a large majority of the time, maybe I wasn‚Äôt...? Anyone have any thoughts regarding this? I can provide more clarification if needed!"
"My boyfriend is starting to get suspicious about me trying to leave him. A couple of days ago he started to scream at me and accusing me of making him look like the bad guy. The thing is that he was saying things that I never talked about out loud and only ever texted to my family. Someone told me about this spying apps and I think he installed one on my phone without me knowing but I don‚Äôt know how to be sure of it. 
Has anyone here ever dealt with this? If he used an app like this how can I make it stop? I appreciate all the help!"
I honestly don‚Äôt really know what else to say. I am still in shock even though it was only two days ago. But when the gun went off she immediately repeats the phrase again and again ‚ÄûI didn‚Äôt mean to do that‚Äú She used the threat of suicide to try manipulate and control me and the situation. I obviously reacted very poorly and was only seeing red at that point. Now she is blaming me for my poor reaction to HER FIRING A GUN OFF IN THE HOUSE NEAR HER FAMILY. I don‚Äôt know how to move forward even alone at this point after such a traumatic event. I could use a friend if anyone is up for the task..
"My wife is...different to me. I'm not sure if it's abusive but tonight I feel really upset and I need some perspective. She's chinese and so I'm not sure if it's a cultural thing or...I don't know.  
I'll just get to it. Yes she does hit me, but I'm a big guy and I can take it. She calls me loser more than she says I love you, she doesn't say I love you anymore since I gained weight and will only ""say it"" once I lose the weight again. She controls all finances, once I get a paycheck it goes right to her account and I am given 100 dollars allowance per week. She constantly calls me a loser, even when I've asked her that the word hurts me, now she says it to me almost daily. I don't know. I feel miserable with her but I don't want to leave because I don't want her to be all alone."
