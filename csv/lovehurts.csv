"So, I met this person on discord, lets call them Isaac (no offence of ANYONE named Isaac ) and we got to know eachother, it was a nice bond, and we were best friends by say 3-4 days. We eventually got together and it was swell, it was an amazing relationship, but it went down-hill. We stopped talking, and one day he announced we should break up, I was devastated but said okay. I'm friends with one of his ex friends, but at that time they were best friends. And it ended up Isaac was blaming me for everything, lied to me for the breakup, and started faking self harm and suicide. 

Here we go.."
"my body aches for you day and night. this isn’t going to be as much as a poem as it is a piece of artwork. modeled in your image. perfection. i lay down at night to sleep and you are the image burned into my eyelids. your head smushed against your pillows. you hair hanging in your face. i can envision every detail of your face like it is the only thing grounding me to the earth. the warmth radiating from your body as i felt your heart beat as if it were in my own chest. every part of me you touch tingles like you are static to my skin. you made me feel electric in every aspect. you may have been just above my surface but it felt as if you were inside of my skin. the blood flowing through my veins, circulating through my system until you consumed me.

i feel as if that is the mere definition of the forbidden fruit. our love was one of the most surreal, chaotic, yet all encompassing passions i have ever witnessed. to be near you was to be complete. yet nothing was correctly calculated. because of this tiny detail all the beauty that once was burns to the ground in no time compared to the strategic effort taken in creating the art that once was.

-see me now"
Since no one I know is on here. I need to let this out somewhere. I'm still in love with a person who would put me down and make assumptions and accuse me of cheating. I gave her my everything. I was so in love with I brought her home to Canada. It's been a year since I dropped her off at the border and not long since I last spoke to her.. I miss her so much. When does it stop. I also have memories popping up on fb. I just want to go back. What makes us want to go back to that?? So stupid.. thank you for reading. And if you have any advice I would love to read them.

". I feel stuck. I dumped a girl because I truly didn’t love her. Got into a relationship with someone that I feel nothing but absolute love for… but it’s hard. She’s incarcerated at the moment. So any anxiety or worry/angst I have about our relationship, I can’t even talk to the one person who has the answers… I’m hurting. I guess I need a hug. I feel numb, like my entire back was stung by wasps."
"I’m new to this platform and community but for a long time I didn’t know how to cope with the fact of losing someone dear to me, but I’m just here to tell you guys there is light shining on the other side it may be hard yet a difficult fight at first but towards the end it’ll make you stronger. I struggled in finding other things to keep my mind out of the hurt and I actually decided to launch a clothing brand which to me signifies the meaning of “Love Hurts” I’m down to share it with any of you guys if interested."
