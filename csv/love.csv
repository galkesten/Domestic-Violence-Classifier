"As we always said, I love you 4L x Beyond. It’s taken me so long to even start to process it. I’m so lucky to have known love. I think I still know it, but without you here I forgot sometimes.. I am burdened by your absence. It fucks me up sometimes even 5 years later. You were my everything and while I’m glad you aren’t suffering, this world feels lacking and even now, empty without your presence.  Through the suffering I’ve had since we last spoke I’ve learned so much.  I understand this world so much deeper and I wish I could share this with you. I think you’d be proud.  I’m doing ok, the best I can sometimes, and sometimes it takes a lot to get through the day.  Our baby is happy, we are going for it.  When I have a hard day, I think about doing it better because you would want that. I feel you with me sometimes. It gives me courage and I’ll show you how I’m strong.. I know I will find that real love again, one that I was so blessed to know with you.  It won’t look the same, but why would it?  I can say now, while as much as I wish you were here, that I believe I’ll find that love.  My muse, mon ami, my best friend and lover, fully encompassing the word. 

I love you
4LxBeyond"
"Good morning and happy Tuesday my beloved friends! I hope you all have a wonderful and productive Tuesday!!! Please send me any prayer requests as you all are dear and special to me! Be a blessing and encouragement to someone in need today! 

“Forasmuch as ye are manifestly declared to be the epistle of Christ ministered by us, written not with ink, but with the Spirit of the living God; not in tables of stone, but in fleshy tables of the heart. And such trust have we through Christ to God-ward: Not that we are sufficient of ourselves to think any thing as of ourselves; but our sufficiency is of God; Who also hath made us able ministers of the new testament; not of the letter, but of the spirit: for the letter killeth, but the spirit giveth life.”

"For me, it’s when she gets excited 

Like she’s relatively childish and so she sees a miniature or small item e.g. picture of baby seagull

And she just can’t contain how excited she is, like it’s a cuteness overload and it’s so wholesome to see

It makes me so happy seeing her get happy over the littlest things because she just and process how cute something is lol"
I just wanted to share that.
"So since 5 months I (m20) got a new workplace and since the first day there was a coworker (f24) that always smiled alittle at me. She was also the one showing me everything at my workplace and I instantly started liking her because she was the nicest und calmest human i ever met. After two months I asked her if she wants to eat something with me, she didn't say no but wanted to wait because at the time she had some trouble with her health, after that I thought I messed it up and she thinks I'm weird, but we got even closer. After a time we bagan to bring each other snacks or something to drink and even though I am a really shy person I feel so comfortable talking with her and get physical contact as if I always would be like that. Since last week our conversations got more deeper and personal and now I'm sure that I love this woman and hope that she feels the same way that I do."
" Well dunno if this is just venting or just wanting to talk and share with someone. This is the second time my boyfriend feels like I don't love him as I used to but I don't really see any big changes to be honest. Plus, he seems to be a lot in his head and keeps having this weird paranoia about me not loving him and honestly he says that so much that the spark will go away eventually even if I don't want to. I just feel like he's not doing too great emotionally and I don't like seeing him like that. He doesn't speak much when we videocall and it's almost hard to conversate with him sometimes. And every time I ask what's wrong he keeps saying these things and seems like he also suspects about having body dysmorphia. Maybe that's why he's behaving like that and started to have all of these paranoias. Plus, we're both a bit unhappy about our job, I'm doing a trial period but I don't think it's the job for me so here I go out there searching again. He's also stressed because of work and this, so. We don't also have much time to call because of work and life in general, so he thinks that might also be the reason for him to be like that. I suggested to put some moeny aside to go and talk to someone cus he'll only benefit from that and also said I'll always be there tu support him in changing for the better. I've always wanted to sort things out with him rather than just leave everything as they are and eventually worsen our situation. I really hope he'll do something for his mental health because he's not doing too well and he doesn't like his image anymore. I dunno, I just feel a bit sad. I'm tired of him being like that tbh and hope he'll do something about it and that he won't neglect himself."

"Perhaps love has no definition 
No two people feel love the same way
Perhaps love is like what good music is
Its definition determined only by the mind of the individual experiencing it, some may say rock, other may say country

We all have our own ideology surrounding love, for me, I dont feel romantic or sexual attraction, but somehow, I find myself with this girl, and it makes me so so happy

Finding live is like finding your new favorite song
You listen to it once, then again, and again, and again, you start to love the music for every little feature about itself, you fall in love with the beat, the lyrics, the instruments, the genre 

Perhaps live is the same way, you talk with someone, then again, and again, and slowly, you start to love not just them, but everything about them, their voice, their personality, their appearance, their own relationship status with you, you fall in love with every detail about them

Love has no true definition much the same as good music has no definition 

We all have our own ideas surrounding both, creating a paradox that gives each of us the power to decide what OUR definition is, whether it be music, or love

You cant say what you think love is, because love is everything, love can be anything, to anyone
It has no definition but it does have meaning"
"TW: Physical abuse; Sexual abuse; Emotional abuse; Suicide

I am 28 years old and I have been in a monogamous love relationship with the love of my life for almost 7 months. I've never had something like this with anyone, so symmetrical and so unconditional. But I feel that love is unconditional only on their part, not mine.

I came from a very violent family background. I suffered emotional and physical abuse during childhood and adolescence by my father, physical and emotional neglect by my mother (with multiple suicide threats), attempted sexual abuse by my stepfather and I saw my father and also my stepfather physically assaulting my mother. Also, my father sexually abused my older sister when I was a baby.

I learned that from the place where love is supposed to come, there is also, attached, the possibility of violence. And that's why I think that today, as an adult, when there is love, I feel afraid. I feel my heart and my body filled with love but also with fear. I frequently get defensive, I'm afraid of being hurt. I have intrusive thoughts of abandonment and rejection, and I've had intrusive thoughts that I was stabbed in the back (it happened to my best friend and my current OS).

I have been in therapy since 2018, I recently changed therapist because the pandemic started to worsen my psychological and psychiatric condition. I also have psychiatric care and take medication for a disorder called cyclothymia.

Will I ever be able to love? I feel like MAYBE I show love out of fear, but I'm not sure because it's so confused... I think that if I don't love, the people I love will leave. I feel love, but I think when I show love, it's out of fear... And this conclusion makes me deeply sad. Thinking about the possibility never in life to be able to love (as an act) makes me want to end things and ""disappear"" from this world. I think that it's not worth to live if I feel unable to love (as an act) my friends, my OS and, worse, future children... And I really want to be a mother. When I ask my SO and my friends of they feel livre, they ALWAYS say yes. But I think they're being deceived my me, maybe because I'm inconsciosly pretty good hidding that I don't know how to love (act), despite feeling love towards them.

Sorry for the long (and maybe confusing) text... I think I'm just looking for testimonies that give me hope and that don't make me feel so alone... Thank you."

"Shes so adorable and I dont know what it is about her that makes her so different from others that I've met, she wanted to do this thing called a queer platonic relationship, a relationship in which you are more than friend but less than lovers

Anyways, I thought that I would be less happy, but in truth this is the happiest I've ever been in my life, she's so amazing and smart and could probably kick my ass in a fight, shes just so fucking amazing and I'm losing my mind, I enjoy my life again, I wake up early to talk to her, I have the inspiration to live again and it's all because I had the guts to be there for her when she felt alone, im so happy with my life and I dont ever want this to end."
"I've seen a lot of posts from people asking how to meet people. I think a lot of media pushes this romanticized view of love at first sight, or ""just knowing"" when you find the one. But it's unhealthy to promote the idea that love is found and recognized right away.

I've always had much more luck with people that were already in my life. Turns out, I'm not so different."
Hey everyone I was just wondering cause I think there's something wrong with me.I like to flirt it's just my personality but I like guys who dont like me back I don't know why? And guys who likes me but can't express it but if they get too clingy or affectionate I always ghost them cause I think it's cringy.
"Sometimes I can’t believe he’s mine. I need to just gush for a minute.

A little about me, I suffer from bad anxiety, depression, OCD, paranoia and insecurity. 

Just back in March/April I was talking to another dude from my university who basically played me like a fiddle. He said I was cute and pretty and sexy, then how much he wanted me, but then said the exact opposite and broke things off. And even tho we weren’t even together, it hurt like hell.

Now everyone in the gaming society in uni (where I found him) turned on me. The boys starting backing each other and they eventually kicked me out because they didn’t listen to my side of the story. People started hating me and stopped talking to me. 

That’s when I met *him*. My boyfriend. After the whole situation, he messaged me on dc and sent a request based on a very brief and kinky convo we had. 

He said he thought I was interesting and wanted to get to know me. At the time, he was talking to a girl who studied the same course as me which is Child Nursing. I knew she liked him, so I stayed away like that. 

I started telling him about my past and trauma. We talked a lot every single day. As friends. 

I catch feelings fast, so a couple weeks in and I’m wondering if he likes me too. I asked the other girl what was happening with them and she said they’re just friends. 

There was then one day where I was being really insecure and I was upset. He went on to say how much he thinks he likes me. I said ‘you don’t like me, you’re confusing your feelings with our kinky shit’ and he went to type a paragraph about what he liked about me, which is when I admitted feelings back.

So we agreed to ‘talk’. We met up the next day as we already planned and I got off at the station so nervous. Both of us. We instantly clicked and talked. We didn’t really be all lovey. But I had a panic attack at one point and I told him how I wanted to put my head on his shoulder and I did. And he came and hugged me. It’s so strange , because we walked side by side so awkwardly without holding hands. 

A couple weeks later, he asked me out when I next saw him. We went to the park, then we went to the cinema on another occasion with my friends. 

The girl who originally liked him said things didn’t work out because he wanted an open relationship (he pretty much gave up after his ex…) So she got annoyed because I changed his perspective. 

He lives a couple hours away, and none of our families know we’re dating. He would come all the way to my area just to see me for maybe 20 mins whilst I go to my local high street to pick up me meds. And he did it a few times a week. 

As part of my studies, I work in the hospital (unpaid) as a student nurse. It’s an hour away and a little, and I get 15 mins break in the morning and 1hr in the afternoon. 

He came all the way over just to see me. Bring me snacks and feed me and be kinky and some PDA shit. (I admit I had a longer lunch..)

He’s now working FULL TIME in a hotel so we can move in together ASAP. It’s been hard for me recently to have 12.5 hr shifts and not see him or even be able to text him. I’m trying to also save money to make it happen.

Because of how I am, my mental health kicks in and I feel so shit again without him. 

He’s so perfect how he calms me down or how he looks at me or says I’m perfect always or is always able to respond to my kinks and make time for me and put me first and everything. 

I love him so much and try to show my appreciation with all the little things I can do. 

We text a little still, and he visits me on his days off. I know he’s doing everything right now for us. 

I’m waiting for us to be able to live together.

Wish me luck please🥰"
"What man wouldnt want to be loved, to be cared for? To have a shoulder to rest on at the end of the day, to have a lap to rest your head on, to have someone who would caress your hair as she listens to you talk about your day, talk about your woes and achievements. What man wouldnt want to remove his shining armor and be vulnerable for once. What man wouldnt want to be held for once and given a place in someone's heart? What man wouldnt want to grow old with someone?

I say no man at all."
"8 Relationship Secrets
When it comes to relationship improvement, pain is the best teacher.

1. Give your partner’s intentions the most benign interpretation realistically possible.
Realistic is the key. Partners can’t assume benign intentions when there’s frightening or shaming behavior. But most negative interactions between partners are not deliberately abusive.

2. Change your partner by changing how you regard your partner.
Chronic resentment makes partners regard each other negatively and project negative attributes onto each other. The most troubling projections are those about character: You’re lazy, selfish, brutish, a nag, a hypocrite. In addition to the invidious bias inherent in character projections, they are the most susceptible to projective identification.

3. Appreciate as many differences as you can and tolerate the ones you can’t appreciate.
The biggest mistake partners make is assuming that events and behaviors mean the same to both of them. If you do that, you’re likely to judge your partner by how you would react. Partners differ in temperament, metabolism, hormonal levels, family history, life experiences, sensitivities, vulnerabilities, and habits, all of which greatly influence the emotional meaning they give to events and behaviors.


4. Replace “getting my needs met” with commitment to your deeper values.
Most perceived “needs” are to relieve, in one way or another, guilt, shame, and anxiety that comes from violating the most humane values.

5. Realize that you can’t be happy in love without being compassionate and kind to loved ones.
Compare a time when you resented your partner with a time that you were compassionate or kind toward your partner. Which made you like yourself better?

6. Your only chance of getting the partner you most want to have is to be the partner you most want to be.
Due to the principle of emotion reciprocity, we're likely to get back what we give. Compassion, kindness, and affection tend to breed compassion, kindness, and affection. Resentment and anger more forcefully breed resentment and anger.

7. To love big, think small.
Small moments of connection are more important to happy relationships than large gestures like romantic weekends or vacations. The latter can actually do harm if followed by the letdown and emptiness of routine disconnection.

8. Instead of blame, denial, and avoidance, choose improve, appreciate, connect, and protect.
The toddler coping mechanisms of blame, denial, and avoidance are the foundation of resentment and, eventually, emotional abuse in relationships."
"Ok so bassicaly ive had a crush on a girl for a couple of years now and idk if she likes me back. Today, i heard her and her best friend talking. Her friend asked her who she wants to be with and then said be with Archie (me) hes smart and stuff like that. My crush said no. But the thing is pretty much all of her friends say we'd be a good couple. Now idk if just because she said no means she doesn't like me back but like if someone asked me if i liked my crush I'd say no cuz  what if she finds out. So according to me she might like me even though she said no. And also she has been showing signs of love by like playfully messing around with me ig and also shes just been showing signs and kinda acting like she likes me. Now idk if she likes me back but e im quite annoyed cuz i dont really know what to. Plz heIp me reddit you always seem to heIp me in life."
"
I didn't fall in love for someone for years since my first relationship in middle school. So far, I've never feel on the same page with a person, I think it is due to an introvert temper and to the gifted pers on than I am. But since this first relationship I used to be always searching for a girl whom may understand me and trying to think outside the box and be herself in life. But it doesn't work, I have to own that I'm fitting in the society but only for dressing codes, here is all where it ends (I'm asian-looking but I'm from an Italian  family and I'm actually french). I'm just dressing myself up well to not be despised by others in street. I think I am the problem and even if it takes years again, I will wait and see for a sticking-out girl."
""
"Yes that's it 1 and half days, I will set myself free of all this bullshit. I've seen even more shit that's been lied about me. O well it's not going to matter soon."
"About 10 days ago my friends and I packed up my little car and hit the road. Our goal for the trip was to find a little bit of peace and natural scenery out west. We're experienced hikers and backpackers, and all three of us guys are enamored with the beauty of the wild. Our first stop was Colorado. Specifically, the Rocky's. We did a three day hike. 21 miles. Two nights at 10,700ft. No one for miles and the scenery was amazing. 

Afterward, we decided to go north. In the middle of the night, we hit a critter. We became stranded on the side of the road until the sun came up. No service and no idea what we could possibly do, we thought we were done. Miraculously, when the sun came up, we realized that we were only a mile outside of an old western town, with a small population and a mechanic who could fix us up. 

We limped into town and we paid for a night at a campground. Normally, we wouldn't bother spending cash on a campsite, but a hot shower and some laundry was much needed.

That's when I fell in love. 

Behind the desk was a sweetheart with a big smile. The two of us couldn't even get through the check-in process without blushing and giggling and every little thing. I held up the line so the two of us could talk about our adventures. I instantly forgot about my busted up car and the bill, and I was smitten. 

We're the same age. She lives on the campground in the summer, and works seasonally. She has a free spirit just like me, and she travels constantly. She's been to all the places I want to go, and has the coolest stories. We talk for hours about Spain, Ireland, Maine, and all our future trips. I can honestly say I've never met a more genuine person in my life. She's also super smart. Like I feel like an idiot when I talk to her. She's so normal too. All the girls I've met on the trail were all a bit lost or confused. This one knows exactly who she is. 

For six days, I was stuck with her while my car was being worked on and I never once felt an ounce of stress about my precarious situation. I even forgot about my friends. On her days off, she took me on trips out of town up into the mountains (the people looking after her on the campground protested). Like some damn Hallmark movie, we hiked up and down little game trails, through miles of absolutely stunning wilderness. We stopped to smell the sage, we sat on hills and looked out over scenic valleys and ridges. The entire time, the two of us didn't stop laughing, and when we returned, we were told that we had a different glow about us. 

She loves rocks, and the two of us waded through glacial creeks for hours, looking at cool stones and crystals. We amassed a small collection. We swam in a subalpine lake. She's a little bad ass. No fear of grizzlies or being out in the middle of wild country. She hikes around on her own all the time and she loves it. 

Being with her felt warm and light. That's the cheesiest and best way to describe it. I'm a very independent and solitary person. I've dated over the years, but never entertained anything serious for long at all. This one feels very different. For years I've told my friends and family that I just want to find a hippie chick to go on adventures with. I guess I found her while I was stranded in the desert. 

At the same time I was falling in love with our campground girl, I fell in love with the little town. I've never felt more at peace anywhere in my life. It's small and simple. One store. Two bars. A post office and a couple gas stations. I loved the little rodeo, and all the quirky people I've met. The best part is how wild this landscape is, and how quickly I can get lost. 

I should take some time, go home, and think about things before I make an impulsive decision. I plan to come back in a few weeks.

She wants me to quit my job and live on the road with her, but we both realize a little bit of a step back and contemplation is much needed. 

I see myself marrying this one. 

Anyway, I'm pretty much writing this out so I can one day sell our story to Netflix in detail. Maybe I'm bragging a bit. Either way, I'm happy. She is too."
"I've had a wonderful day out at the cinema with my love today. The content I felt as I sat next to them and we watched the film in silence is something I want to be able to remember for long to come. I'm so happy with her, however, in two days she's going on a holiday for the rest of the summer holidays, so I'll really miss her."
"My ex and I were together for like 3 months we broke up like 3 weeks ago it was a mutual break up even though he said it first, I had the break up text in my notes for about a week. From the very first moment we broke up we are very much good. That night we refused to say goodnight and had a 2 hr conversation and hung out the next day. We never stop texting or calling each other everyday. We did stopped the pet names and the lovey emojis right away, but we still cared and flirted w each other. We still hangout every week and I will admit we still kiss and has sex. When we hangout we let it slip we love each other still. And in text he tells me he misses me and I do too! I try my best not to reciprocate but I just can’t. I do, I still love him. I kinda have an urge and try again. Last night I kinda let it slip how I thought it was weird how we broke up but we basically are doing the same thing when we were together but we’re just calling each other more and talking longer. He did said it feels like the break up never happened but he said it feels like there no pressure or paranoia in case “one day I do just ghost him” 


Idk should I just stop this friendship completely. I do want something more still. :( 
The label “friends” is becoming harder"
"I think I might be in love with this girl. Everything in me is screaming to tell her but there's one thing holding me back. It's the contradictions between her words and her actions. She says she loves me, does this multiple times a day and looks up at me and says I know you love me too. I don't confirm it verbally because I really don't want to get my heart broken.
Her actions speak a different story. She wants to have a hot girl summer - she keeps saying this to all of our friends. She constantly flirts with one of my friends and is having sex with another.

Even if she is waiting for me to admit that I love her and ask her to be my girlfriend, I don't think her love for me is genuine. She would not be doing these things with other people which she quite well knows hurt me. I play it cool because we aren't a thing but I am in no way okay with this and few people would be. I don't think she's ready for a relationship and just want to have fun but happened to caught feelings for me but they aren't really that genuine imo."
"Omg guys. Literally have fallen in love so fast and passionately. Within meeting him everything in my life has gone and felt right. A few days before our formal introduction, I felt this burst of joy and pure knowing that I’m going to fall deeply in love and have it reciprocated. Then it finally happened. 

Context: he was my Starbucks barista and I would go there often to see him.

We are so alike, we hate and like the same niche things. He understands me more than anyone ever has. We click so well even though we’ve hung out only twice. Ive never felt such an intense, bursting feeling of passion and love and knowing. I feel like I’ve known him forever. I’ve written so much about him. My life feels like it went from grey to yellow, from darkness to sunshine."
"
he is the beaming sun on a vibrant blue skied day. he is finally the light and warmth i’ve yearned for, being so cold, ostracized in the darkness. he doesn’t take flattery very well, but i was made to admire him. he loves that i admire him. i love that i admire him. i have affirmatively felt this spark and grandiose, cosmic connection with him from the moment we got close. i didn’t recognize him with his mask on; i didn’t recognize his soul. i have never felt this way before. i have never felt so invigorated, motivated, playfully sporadic. is he me? is my soul? does he feel it too? does it mean the same amount to him? does he resonate as deeply with me as i to him? i meant it when i accidentally said i love you. i have never met someone like you. i am amazed at your being. you make me want to be a person and do things with my life. i have waited for someone like this for so long."

"I’ve never been in a relationship before. I’m only 15 years old, and so is she. Not so long ago she confessed and said that she wants to get together with me, and that she doesn’t mind the distance. What should I do? I’ve always been afraid of online dating. What’s your opinion of online dating? Is it valid or not?"
"We’re in an LDR and sometimes he has to keep his camera off for his calls. Whenever I do get to see him I just melt so much every time. He’s sooooo cute and the best part is he’s the sweetest fucking guy I’ve ever met in my whole life. 

One time this guy asked his grandma to teach him how to waltz with a partner because he wanted to dance with me someday. 

U SEE WHAT I MEAN?? Ahjahsiandisnsjwowbsosnsbsj my GOD I simp too much for this man he’s so uggggggghhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh

I want to have his child. I swear."
I want to be in bed with him. I’m not talking about sex then passing out. He’s better than that. I’m talking about just laying next to him. Rolling over and finding my way to his body. Being held tight and feeling protected by his bigger frame. Finding his hand in mine like an uncontrollable attraction even in our sleep. Being kissed on my forehead as I lay my head on his chest. Feeling his heart beat as he’s happy relaxing under me. Intertwining our bodies in our unconscious states. Just being connected like one. I just want to be in bed with him.
"Hi. I’m a Japanese. Maybe I think since I have ever had any girl friend feeling that to have just one girlfriend or marry with one girl is empty or lone i was thinning. It is guessing though I had been polyamory.

I’m not a girl. profile pic is hair color changed me.

My girl who was about to become my girlfriend said please change that don’t feel lonely that having me. Yeaaa of course don’t feel it

So I changed.

However since I have Asperger I was really really Idiot and insensitive. I was keep setting my profile where we met that who wants to become my one of girl friends.

Even though I had this bad point to be doubted I was worrying are you ok. Her worry is really lovely though…

She has been muting so long so I thought about it lots and guessing lots.

Finally, she answered “see? You don’t know. I don’t know you too”.

“You want to become couple with everyone you talk with”.

I said no if I am so I have ever had gf.
And the next is the biggest and worst misleading answer.

I was like showing sincere that I have bad points like saying pro and cons….

I said “But I wanted to have many girlfriends”……

It means I used to want many girlfriends before I meet her. The best way of expression was, “It is good that I don’t want to become anybody I talk with. But this is bad that I wanted to have many girlfriends before even though I meet you like special person and I am totally mine”.

But actually she felt I wanted to have many girlfriends even though I am going to have you, I was calming that I cant have many girlfriends since I chose you, or I am not choosing anybody but the profile is for having many girlfriends besides you……….

No no no. I’m a really kind person and dont against her. I am able to get many girls but I don’t do that.(don’t think contradiction) but I don’t do that and chose her. I am ok that if we could marry she’s the only one person I kiss in the life. Even though I’m really perverted….

So sorry that I couldn’t care about you and injured you. She must be not trusting love. She’s introvert. My type. Always at home like me. And shes really beautiful.

So I am running rutube and youtube. So that I become famous in Russia.

4 Tips For the First Year Of A Relationship which will Strengthen Your Love within the future

"I’m a 14f hes 14m( I dont know if this helps i just want to say it as its been boiling inside me for weeks) i’ve know this guy since we were in 1st grade and since then weve had an off and on relationship since then. This past year we completely ignored each other and i really wanted to talk to him but we used to be really close friends the year before and it would be akward so i didnt but on the last day of school he texts me and ive never been happier at a notification, since then ive moved to a different country where he wakes when i go to sleep and ill go to school here for a few months  but we still talk.( I also used to be very shy and still am a little) Every time i see that he wrote me something i light up with joy, i try denieing that i like him( i still do) but everytime he texts me or we talk in person i cant controll myself and i become so energetic and bubilly( and annoying) to the point i cringe while talking to him. I cant imagine how much of a pain i am to him. i also used to make fun of him,and ive told him secrets ive done everything to get him to open up, show emotion and he wont budge. I dont know anything about him but he knows so much about me and probaly doesnt care. I always text first, since we started talking to each other again I cant go a day without telling him small deatails about my day(He probably doesnt know how hard I try), ive tried to minimalize how much i share with him to be less anoying, and once he siad ""tell me more"" and since then I cant get him out of my head. I never viewed him romanticly (1. because I know he would break my heart, 2. because weve always been friends) i still cant comprehend how i feel about him. I cant invision him in a romantic way because i dont know him.

Why cant I get him to show any emotion.

Why cant I get him to tell me about his day

Why wont he?"
"I had a situationship with a guy one time where we were both very attracted to each other, which is extremely rare for both of us, but where we decided to not get into a relationship because we were both afraid of relationships, of overestimating the attraction, of wanting love more than anything else and then being disappointed and losing each other. It’s like we loved each other, but were afraid of what was standing between us and could hurt us both. 

Now I’m wondering if we gave in to that initial skepticism too fast and that if we had tried it might have turned out better than expected. Have you ever had a relationship where you were a bit skeptic in the beginning, but that came out well later on?"
"Every night my boyfriend comes to my side of the bed to grab my water cup, goes and fills it up, snuggles me until I fall asleep—
Even though he normally works super late and needs to wind down. So he cuddles me,  so I don’t have to fall asleep alone ever again — the king of never breaking promises. After 10 years of knowing him, and 7 years apart and coming back together, I sometimes get teary-eyed thinking of 16 year old me. I wish I could hug her and tell her it happens. You finally get to be his wife, don’t give up, don’t lower your standards, this is one of the many reasons you chose life."
"I just realized I was in love with the first and only girl who made me feel butterflies in my stomach.
Only now, that she has gone around the world. Only now, that she has left with the intention of moving to another country.

I also realized it was love at first sight, at least for me.

I fell in love with a girl I've only seen a few times, but that was enough to make me dizzy and drive me crazy.

I didn't fall in love with her for her beauty.  I care little or nothing about that, considering her wonderful character.
Her spontaneity, her somewhat hidden shyness, her strength and grit, her disarming kindness, her contagious happiness. I love everything about her.

With just one smile he could make my heart beat so much it hurt, almost as if he were going out."

"Me (M, 22) and my ex (F, 22) have been broken up for a year but have been chatting regularly over the past couple weeks since my birthday. I suspect that she might have hidden feelings for me still that she’s scared to admit but I’m also lowkey scared to ask her out incase she rejects me. The reason why I suspect that she still has feelings for me is because I posted going out on a date with another girl for the first time on Snapchat and she instantly deleted me as soon as she viewed it. She added me back the next day but those actions have led me to believe that there’s still feelings there on both sides. Also, we spoke on the phone last week and she told me that her head is still over the place about whether she wants to get back together or stay single.

I still love my ex from the bottom of my heart and would do anything to get back with her cuz she means everything to me. There were issues from the previous relationship which I’ve reflected on and really want to right those wrongs if we were to ever try again. I’ve tried moving on by dating other girls but it just don’t feel right and there isn’t that romantic, intimate connection that I have with my ex every time I see her.

It’s been on my mind for the past 2 days but I want to ask her out to a clubbing event on the 30th July which I know she would enjoy. In the past, we’ve met up and gone out to several restaurants, cocktail bars and mini golf places as exes but for some reason, I’m more scared than ever to ask her out this time.  Should I ask her out and if so, what would be the best way to approach this ?"
I'm 22 years old and I never dated. I'm losing hope and I feel lonely all the time. Dont know why but I feel depressed just thinking about it.
"I know in college admissions, there is a phenomenon of colleges rejecting applicants they think overqualified because they don't want to extend an offer to someone who will likely turn them down and thus reduce yield. 

That's a long-winded way of asking whether people know of something like this happening with people. One of my friends is one of the most attractive and sexy people I know, and (conceding perhaps some bias) I actually think has a good personality. Plenty of people are willing to be with her sexually, but nobody seems to want to stick around past a few dates. (Same sex relationships, if that matters). 

Part of me wonders if people are bailing out before they develop feelings, because when you develop feelings, jealousy seems to come with it, and of course falling out of love is harder than falling in love, and they don't want to be stuck pining for the most beautiful person they've met if the relationship ends, or jealous if she ends up with someone else. 

There could be alternative explanations, and of course I am looking for those. But I was wondering if people had ever noticed anything like this in dating?"
"I feel like I have a pattern of falling for people that I barely know or actually truly like. I make up this idea of them in my head. And the only reason I like them is because they made me feel seen and validated. Am I seriously so easy??? I don’t get why I can’t move on from this weird cycle and I don’t know when it keeps repeating. 

For example, I was in a group project with people and I pitched my idea and this cute said great idea and continued complimenting me. We never met it was just a random group session for class and we never talked again because we are on zoom for classes. And now I can’t get my mind off him and it’s infuriating!! Like I never met you how are you on my mind all the time….

Someone explain this to me please…."
"my coworker. there's something between us. 

a customer. a regular customer. there's something between them. 

They're strangers, but I believe there's love between them. 

And it hurts me when she talks to him. And how he's so friendly. 

He loves her.

But I don't want to hurt her, and I don't want to hurt him. 

He loves me.

But we're still strangers. If that makes sense."
"


The thing about Real love? Is that it can never hurt. Only our bad experiences…our worst trials. Make love sometimes appear the worst. Love was never meant to be a game. Never supposed to make us cry. But when one abuses our love and betrays us? Our hearts want to give up the fight. When love is abused…and trust is broken like a seal. It is the pain that blinds us. And make us wonder if true love is even real. When our love for the one in the past was only left to wither….it is the rejection we feel that makes us cold and bitter. But the one that chooses to look past the heart in the very face of pain? Is indeed the one who knows love is true. And this truth is how we begin again.😊💕💕Don’t ever think that love is the reason for your pain. Love will never hurt us. It was never meant to be a game. 



As a female…I know sometimes it feels that every man will hurt you. And no man will treasure your heart. But I believe that not all men are the same .😊💕 Men have been hurt by women too. Not all women will break your heart. A soul that will cherish your heart no matter what. This is the love I wish for. And you wish for it too.🥰"
"This is probably one of the most painful things I have ever experienced. 

I wish we could be there for each other in the way that we both want. We are both in such bad places that I know it isn’t healthy for us to be together. We depend on each other too much. Only being happy when we’re with each other is not healthy, and we both need to learn how to be happy with ourselves first. 

I wish you would let me in. I know you’re scared of being hurt again. For me, I have always been scared of failure. But I don’t care with you. For the first time in my life I’d rather try and fail than to have never tried at all. I wish you felt the same, but I understand how you feel all too well, and I am so sorry.

I wish you could understand that because I love you I can look past the mistakes you’ve made and see you as the beautiful person you are. I love how you make me feel. I have never trusted someone the way I did you. Before you I didn’t think anyone could ever love me. You’ve made me feel beautiful.

I’m scared of the future and what it holds for us moving forward. But if nothing else, please know I love you so much. I know you love me and I am so lucky to have met you. Please take care of yourself. All I want is for you to be happy.

I love you."
"Too short? 

Too tall? 

Scars?

Acne?

Yellow, crooked teeth?

""Weak"" jawline?

Asymmetrical features?

Whatever your ""flaws"" may be, 

It does NOTHING to hide the beauty that your soul RADIATES from within. And I am speaking from experience. When I call someone I love beautiful, I'm not talking about how ""perfect"" their body is according to society's standards. Some people don't understand this because they're blind to what true beauty is. Yes physical beauty exists, but even that is more subjective than a lot of people think. 

Beauty cannot be defined. It is simply known and felt. It isn't objective. It's hard to capture in words. And everyone has a slightly different understanding of it."
"Love is selfish

Or is it selfless?

I think it's both."
Usually I’m fine with being alone but every day I lose a little more hope in finding someone to call mine.
"I'm soooooo tired of waiting for you.  Please just come fill that gap in my heart, I'm tired of having mo one to hold, and vice versa.  I'm tired of not having you with me.  I dont WANT to go through all the relationships that will fail.  I dont want to have to wait for you.  I want you NOW

I don't want to have to work on myself to be a better person for when you arrive, even though I do and know that I have to keep it up so I can be with you. 

I want to have those awkward convos at first we can feel our hearts fluttering with every glance when the other isnt looking, and then at some point we catch the other and lock eyes for a moment and look away quickly.

I want to be able to make love with each other, feel your skin on mine, our bodies locked and moving at the same time.  I wanna fall back into bed with you, and have you play with my hair, and I can compliment your every scar and curve and line.  From the imperfections on your face and hair to the curves in you lips, and I wanna kiss your body, and face all over.  I want to talk and be open, and wake up next to each and both of us be eager for another round, and to be together and support each other.  I cannot express how much I have a thirst for love like I do with water.  And i especially have a thirst for you, my lovely little butterfly"
I couldn't be happier to have a man like my partner in my life. I thank God for bringing him into my life. I am eternally grateful. I pray that I can call my partner my husband after the pandemic is over. I love you honey.
"I have always been taught to prioritize others rather than doing things for myself, but the since I entered middle school many many years ago, my desire to be loved has grown with me, and I feel as if its to the point where I should go against my wishes and look for a girlfriend. Any thoughts are greatly appreciated."
"Why did I fall in love?, it feels like hell what heinous crime did I commit that I am being punished like this?"
What did I do to deserve to feel like this?
"First time there was a lot of chemistry, but i didn't had the guts to do it, so i didn't, now i'm entering with full force to tell her how i feel. We're meeting at her house.  
Do you have like a phrase or something? I truly want things to go well."
"Met this girl randomly on my yacht one day when i had friends on board. I didn’t know who she was or who friends were but my friends were extremely excited to hang out with this group of tatted, slender, confident and nice ladies, so naturally i was too. From the moment she came on board she was flirtatious and lifted all of our spirits. For a while i even felt light hearted and calm, a sort of bliss that i only experience when i feel like everyone is at peace and in the moment with me. 

She then continued on to display her love for the same things that i am passionate about, which is very rare for me to find in my life! Long story short it was a blast to meet her. 

I immediately invited her to spend next weekend with me and i experienced a very strange but pleasurable night. Leaving me with no regret other than wishing that i had the opportunity to make love to her in a more private and intimate place. But sadly it happened under the stars with her friend “sleeping” right next to us with some guy that she met that night. i guess these girls might be sluts. But they surely love to have fun. 

The next morning we returned home kissed and promised to see each other soon. Texted for a day and a half. My heart was longing for her as if she were my first love. But then she said she’s going away for a while and i never had the chance to see her. 
It’s been 2 weeks since and she  hasn’t replied to my text, returned my calls, or even looked my social media. I’ve told her friend that I’m being ghosted and she reassured me not to worry. 

Sadly, I realize that she impacted me greatly and I would’ve loved to love her but i will never let a girl act as if she is too busy to send me text or any sign that she cares. I deserve better. It amazes me though how spending 30 hours with someone in the span of a week has left me with such a crater to fill."
"Happy Wednesday my friends! I hope you all have a wonderful and productive day! Please send me any prayer requests if you all need anything! Cheer up someone having a bad day and a blessing in people’s lives, just a call/text can change someone’s day!

“The Lord hath done great things for us; whereof we are glad. Turn again our captivity, O Lord, as the streams in the south. They that sow in tears shall reap in joy. He that goeth forth and weepeth, bearing precious seed, shall doubtless come again with rejoicing, bringing his sheaves with him.”
‭‭Psalm‬ ‭126:3-6‬ ‭KJV‬‬

"He listens to me. 
We can talk on the phone for hours. 
He calls me beautiful even when I’m in my pyjamas with no makeup on. 
He tags me on his Instagram post. 
He always holds my hand in public. 

I feel so loved and appreciated. 🥰"
"My boyfriend and I celebrated our one year anniversary a week or so ago and he finally told me what he got me. 

Our whole relationship I've raved about Star Wars and how sexy lightsabers are, and I guess he remembered all those conversations!

He told me tonight that he'd ordered me a lightsaber and it might take a while longer to arrive, and I swear, when he told me I nearly cried. 

I've always wanted a sword and when my grandparents gave one to my brother, I was salty, but now I'm going to have a whole ass lightsaber!

I love this man so much, and I can't say it enough, I've already told all my friends but I just needed to tell the world how much I love him.

I can't wait for my very own lightsaber to arrive and I can't believe I'm lucky enough to spend the rest of my life with this man."
"The idea of spark or passion really intrigue me. 

I've experienced a 'spark' with a person. This very same spark seems to have caused me a lot of emotional pain. We were together for literally 3 months. There is something nostalgic when I look back on when we met. We went out to a nice Italian restaurant with a candle lit dinner. Sat in the corner. Very romantic than I'd usually go for. 

However, after picking up on some red flags that were stressing me the fuck out, I ended it. Looking back now, and with my current girlfriend, we've discussed this 'passion' or 'spark'. We've come to the conclusion that it can be very harmful in relationships. Even destructive. 

For example, in her case, she wanted to 'save' the guy. She wanted to change him (drug habit). It ended up with her being cheated on. For both of us, having that intense spark or passion has been bad. Although, what I must mention is that there is a difference having that spark and still liking someone a lot. 

The idea of the spark is strange because, what actually is it? A connection between you and someone else? A feeling that only you two could have? Is it real or is it just obsession? Is it inherently unhealthy? I feel as though it is these connections that haunt us and are the conduit for intolerable nostalgia.  

I'm curious what others think? What is your relationship with the 'spark'? Has it been good or bad? 

P.S This is just a disclaimer. After personal issues I've gone for a more peaceful life and now look upon things with a different view. I don't get obsessed with expectation and hope. I simply look for what will give me peace in the long-term. Someone or something that not make my life miserable as life is difficult as it is. Thanks."
"I had a really bad day. I won't go into the details because they're irrelevant, but the torment didn't stop all day. There was nothing my boyfriend could do to stop it.

At night, when I was all tucked into bed and ready to sleep, he was next to me. I was feeling so bad after having a bad day that I broke down just as we were about to fall asleep. He sat upright and I thought he was annoyed with me, that made me cry a bit more. He sat cross-legged, took me by my arm (I was facing away from him) and just said ""come here"" in a soft whisper.

I sat on his lap, wrapped my arms and legs around him and cried. It was a chilly night so he wrapped the blanket around the both of us and slowly rocked back and forth while rubbing my back slowly and giving me light/soft kisses here and there. At one point he whispered ""cry your heart out if you want to dear, ive got you"". And I did, I cried quite a bit but it was okay, he was there, rocking me back and forth gently in his embrace, reassuring me and giving me soft kisses throughout.

After I was done, I felt so much better. I was smiling and giggling a bit too. He gave me more kisses, quickly ran his fingers through my hair, smiled and tickled me too. It was such a nice feeling after crying so much that my eyes felt sore. He cuddled with me to sleep, making sure I was okay. 

I'm so grateful."

"These past 5 months I've been a completely different person. I don't know where any of it came from but I've been hit with massive anxiety and am constantly worried about dropping dead at any moment. I've never has anxiety before. This is very irrational and I've gotten a bit better. However, I have been hit with some real ailments as well. My brain has been very foggy, I get confused and I'm just very self absorbed in terms of worrying about myself more than giving her appreciation. My girlfriend has been so patient and caring through all of this. I wouldn't be able to handle it without her. I want to do something BIG for her to show my appreciation. To let her know that she's still on my mind daily and that everyday I fight to get back to where I was 5 months ago just for her. I don't know what to do though and this alone is out of character for me. I normally would come up with something very clever but this brain fog has messed me up. Any ideas on something good and grand?"
"Hey Jack,
It’s me. Wow. I don’t really know where to begin with this. I’m writing this, not just because it’s your birthday, but because I never really thanked you for…well, everything. How you were always there by my side since I was little and are here now. How I got so lucky to have you as my uncle, I’ll never understand. 

One of my earliest memories of you would probably have to be when I was 4 or 5. I was sitting on your lap and we were watching baseball on TV. You kept getting annoyed because I kept reaching up and touching your beard. I remember in those early days when you had a certain edginess to you. Like you always were on guard for some reason. I didn’t understand why then but I of course do now. But even then, even when you looked like you were angry and didn’t want anything to do with any of us, I never was afraid of you. In fact, I felt safe around you even then. I still do now. 

What happened with him, my dad, I don’t really feel like going into here. I remember how excited I was to finally meet him after he’d been locked up almost my whole life. I thought he would be just as happy to meet me as I was him. But, sadly, that wouldn’t be the case. He wanted nothing to do with me, my mom or any of us. I think you know where I’m going with this. The day when I was 14 and I had my first (and thankfully only) severe emotional breakdown and turned my room upside down out of anger. You just happened to be there and came to my rescue. Of course, I tried attacking you anyway because of how angry I was at the world. But as soon as you held my face in your hands and we looked at each other, I remember how scared you looked. All you did next was pull me in for a hug and hold me tight as I bawled my eyes out, nearly passing out from exhaustion in the process. I didn’t think much about it then, but I remember it was also the first time you called me “baby girl”. Something about those words, even to this day, made me feel so much different about you in a positive way. Like you saw me as your own. And I think I was right. 

I know from then on, we spent more and more time together. I miss those days. Watching movies with you until we both fell asleep on the couch, going on hikes and you carrying me on your back, you trying to teach me to cook and me nearly burning your kitchen down, teaching me how to drive, so much more. I even remember when I had my first prom, not only did you go dress shopping with me, you also offered to do my makeup for me just because, even though you hadn’t the faintest idea what you were talking about. But what really, really made me love you as much as I do now is when I overheard you on the phone with someone and you said “I’m with my kid this weekend. I can’t come”, or something like that. You called me your kid. That nearly made me cry. And now I am as I write this thinking about it. 

Okay, this has probably gone on long enough. I’ll end this by saying what I said in the beginning: thank you. Not just for being there for me through practically everything, or always believing in me or any of that. Thank you  for being my dad. I know everyone has a mother and father, but a mom or dad can be anyone, and you are definitely one and then some. Even when I was at my lowest or when I was angry at you or the world about something, you always knew it was only temporary. You’ve always been great like that. Being open and honest all the time, as well as forgiving. It’s what I love most about you and always have. I know you said before that you love me like I was your own. Well now you know I feel the same as if you were my dad. Always have and always will. I can’t wait until next year when you get to walk me down the aisle at my wedding. 

Love, now and always, your baby girl,

Faye"
"I’m (21m) super excited because I really think my coworker crush (19f) likes me back. She’s shown so many signs that she likes me. The other day I asked her why she’s sarcastic and teases me all the time. At first she said that it’s just her personality, but then she said there’s a reason she’s so sarcastic. But she said that she’ll “tell me why, later” and I shouldn’t worry about it.  She also said that she’s sarcastic to her family because “that’s how she shows love”...

Today, I brought it up because a coworker mentioned her being sarcastic. I jokingly said that “later” meant I’ll never know why. My crush then said that she’ll tell me why she’s sarcastic and teases me in two weeks. 

Guess what happens in two weeks? Her last day at work. Meaning it’s possible that she’ll tell me she likes me after she leaves work. I’m planning on asking her out when she leaves, so I’m definitely liking my chances!!"
"It’s like your lips were made for mine; the way they crash together disrupts time. 
With hearts aligned, we sat in the hotel just staring at the view. Watching planes fly out wondering where they were going...

The whole time knowing it couldn’t be anywhere better than here together in that moment.

We sat and talked for hours and then sat some more in silence. Just holding and stroking each other; trying to appreciate the moment.

Let’s not rush this connection. Let’s enjoy it like it’s our last time falling in love. Let’s remember every second. Let’s keep it continuing so we don’t have to start reminiscing. 

Talking to you- the words flow so easily. I’m an INFJ but you have me speaking my way of thinking. Advocate to the Commander. I swear I’m not trying to pander. 

Let’s live in this moment and collide with the present. We can worry about tomorrow, tomorrow. And tomorrow never comes.

I’m trying to live in the present moment but my mind keeps drifting back to the past where I can be with you in my memories. 

I pull myself back to the now but you’re not around, so I fling myself to the future and fantasize of where we could be. 

Home was here and then I went there, and now home is 1000 miles away, with you. I just need you near. 

It’s like your lips were made for mine; the way they crash together disrupts time."
"We have all made mistakes in relationships. Toxicity is sometimes not ingrained with yourself. Having ever been jealous is normal and you shouldn't feel guilty about it. 

Every misstep we take in a relationship, inevitably gives us the opportunity to grow, mature and improve for that, or for future relationships. 

Do not be so hard on yourself. You are not a monster. You just made mistakes, like any human being in the world. For future experiences, you will know how to react without affecting that person you love, and you will feel proud of yourself."

"It happened in October 2014, I was 15 then. I'm 22 now. This was back when I was religious (I'm agnostic today). 

My brother and I went to this church that had a separate building for the middle and high scores students. To pass the time while waiting for the sermon to begin, my brother and I threw a football together. Nothing special really. I then decided to throw the ball really far and told him to catch it. But I realized I threw it too far and saw it was going to hit the back of a girl who was facing her friends and away from me. I shouted, ""Look out!"" But it hit her back and I got nervous immediately thinking she was going to be really mad at me. Turns out, she was really forgiving. She was laughing and had a huge smile on her face. She walked up to me with her arms at a 45° angle and asked for a hug. I accepted it.

We wrapped our arms around each other and I felt so cozy in her arms. She even whispered ""I love you."" to me even though we don't know each other. I said to her, ""I love you, too."" I love the way she felt in my arms and the scent her hair gave off. I felt like I could fall asleep in her arms with my chin resting in top of her shoulder. I wanted it to last forever. I felt more cozy as time went on. Although eventually, my arms were starting to get tired. So I let go. I really hope I made her feel so special and loved while she was in my arms. Like someone actually cares for her and will be there to save her from all her worldly problems. 

Once we let go, she shook my hand and tried to get to know me better. I was too shy and awkward to do this. Which my shyness was amplified when she introduced me to her other girl friends. I have a feeling that if it happened today, maybe I'd actually get to know her better and her girl friends rather than seeing her once and never again.

To this day, I look back on that hug with incredible nostalgia. I legitimately want to relive it. It truly set the golden standard to me what an amazing hug feels like. By the time I get a girlfriend, I want to express my love to her by giving her the most amazing hug she'll ever experience in her life. 

Thanks for reading."

"My bf and I have been together for just about three years now. I love him so much. I feel like he’s literally the perfect person for me. 

Well one night we were at his place cuddling on the couch, watching a show and eating cake. I try to be cute, so I dab a little bit of icing on his nose. He gives me a look then grabs a whole glob of icing and *spreads it all over my cheek.* So what do I do? I turn toward him and blow cake chunks at him, hit him directly in the middle of his face. He jolted back and made surprised noises. I laughed so hard I almost couldn’t breathe. I won that one. 😁

And no the cake chunks weren’t all goopy, I had *just* put them in my mouth seconds prior so they were still firm."
"sometimes when I zone out with my thoughts I start getting this really overwhelming feeling. a tightness in my throat. I don't think I've ever loved someone the way I love my partner. it's indescribable. when I see his family and they enjoy my presence. when we run into one of his friends in the grocery store and I get to be introduced to them. it's an awesome feeling.

I've been having a hard time mentally due to a variety of things, mostly covid anxiety and my new birth control - yet when I have these good days they feel amazing. I feel like I'm getting a lot better. of course there are times when I have crazy anxiety or I'm going through a sensory overload but he always gets me through it. I could be bawling my eyes out and he'll have his head resting on my hip, smiling at me as if I was the most beautiful thing on this planet. 

I've always been scared to be vulnerable or ""letting someone in"", but he knows me so well. I want to work on myself for the both of us. he's so patient and kind and even though the past year has been a rollercoaster, he's been by my side through all of it. 

I pray he stays for the rest of my life."

"**I'm here to share my First kiss story** 

I was 20 years old my GF was 18 yrs I know you are thinking how he is 20 and never kissed a girl, I've kissed a girl before but not on the mouth xD 

So I knew this girl from school she was younger than me we used to see each other on the break 

but I used to hate her I never thought she could be my gf , one day at the end of the school day she talked to me it was my last year in school we sit in the garden behind the school we talked but i wasn't feeling that I'm attracted to her we talked about school only when i wanted to go she told me where is my kiss before you go i kissed her on her cheek because i wasn't really attracted to her and she is no my type she has a small body - straight hair - brunette - and she act so bitchy (by bitchy i mean she talks to a lot of guys and her look give you this vibe ) so one day in the summer vacation she replied on one of my IG story it was about something have to do with kobe brayn we chat for a bit then she wanted to call me i asked her why , she said you want to answer or no i said yes  at the time i was tired and life was not going my way , the conversation was weird i needed someone to talk to at the time , we talked about a lot of things about my track and field career about future about relions because she

 was from different religion and i was feeling so good she made me forget some of the pain that I've been through after about 1 hours of talking she asked me are you okay my heart  i said I'm good and i told her i want to go to sleep she said call me tomorrow i want to know what is wrong  i didn't want to call her 

(I'm gonna skip a this part of the story because it  so big ) so the next day we called and i told her every thing and she started to tell me every thing about her and we start to call or video call each other every day 

at this time i started to like her soul i liked her personality she was like a pain killer for me i was so romantic with her but i was scared i was saying why a girl like her is talking to a guy who is 20 yrs old who have thin hair and not look so good i mean okay I'm athletic and i look good and hot as if i wear a cap-hat but if i don't my thin hair and my shit hairline make me look so bad 

one day she told me she was going to the track and field playground because she had a session there I'm a part of the track and field team so i told her ill be there 

the day we meet i had training and she had a class but we meet 2 hours before ,when i say her on the track i wasn't shy because I'm not this type of guy we talked for a bit and decided to go to this place behide the school it was like a mountin that have the city and the airport and sea view it was around 5m walk from school when we got there we sat on a little bench we talked a little bit i was so happy and in love and idk how suddly I'm attracted to her 

when  we were talking suddly she looked at me for around 5 sec without saying any word i knew something is wrong she come closer to me i knew she wanted to kiss me i was feeling it and i wanted to kiss her but i didn't know how so she did the job and she initiate the kiss so when she get closer i closed my eyes and we kissed for about 10 sec it was the best feeling the kiss was warm it was kiss of love i never felt like this before but for some reason i got a little bit hard i wasn't thinking in sex in anyway i was enjoying kissing the girl that i fall for love in  

after the kiss i didn't notice i was a bit hard we were silent after the kiss i tried to fix my penis without her seeing but she noticed me and giggled she grabbed my hand and put it one her boobs i squeezed them for a bit then she grabbed my hand and put it on her inner thighs , my penis was not hard but it was between the two xD when my hand was on her thighs she put her hands on my short and touched my penis we touched each other for about 1 m then we left to the track 

her class was in the track so i skipped the training and decided to stay and watch the class i was allowed to stay because i was the coach assistance and i knew everyone there  and i also demonstrated few runs for the class with the coach like the proper tecinecs for the 200m and the 100 m and how to set the starting blocks ... 

after the class ended she wanted me to open my phone for her i didn't want but she kept saying to open it at the end i did  and she just look at all my contacts and the people i chat with 

they she had a basketball class so i decided to leave because i knew nothing about basket ball we talked for a little before i go and when i wanted to go she gave me my necklace that she took from my neck when i saw her at start so  she removed it  i lowerd  my neck because she wanted to put it on me she put it and kissed my neck in the most romantic way and then we hugged and i left .

hope you liked my story this story is less than a year old and also non of this is fake and tbh i skipped a lot of stuff 

what i leared from this story that don't judge on how people will look because the girl i used to hate now i love and i belive we will get married one day 

i love her and i will protect her and i will put my life on the line for her ."
"Love is when you can sit there and be your genuine self with someone, and they are enamored with your rawness. 

Love is when you remove all of the filters, and face each other bare in truth. 

Love is when you are true to yourself, and they think it’s beautiful. 

That’s what love is."

"I love a girl who hates me. We've parted ways but I can't get over her. I'm unable to normally carry out daily routine tasks, coz of there waves of sadness. I miss her all the time. Nothing I try seems to take mind off of her. Is there something wrong with me?"

"(posting on this subreddit because I just feel super alone)

Yall my ex boyfriend said ""let's continue talking and going on adventures together"" and even proposed the idea of ""being best friends"" right after he broke up with me a couple of days ago to now he is barely talking to me and leaving me on read all the time. It's so painful to go from talking everyday to barely at all like this now. Also, he told me he broke up with me because the kind of love he had for me was of a friend love, but we barely talk now so maybe he was just saying that, I don't know.

It hurts how you go from talking everyday and telling each other things you haven't told anyone else to barely talking at all now. I know we broke up, but I thought we would at least keep talking. Maybe he just didn't value the connection we had, romantic or not, at all.

This is just the most painful thing ever, I can literally feel the physical pain from this in my stomach and heart. It's been effecting me so much that I can barely eat because i've lost my appetite, I can barely sleep now in the mornings as I keep waking up, I just feel like sleeping and doing nothing all day now, all I want to do is be alone in my room. I just value him so much because we're like inverted versions of each other. We understood each other like nobody else could, each others type of weird, we thought the exact same way.

I just don't understand how we could be from going that close to barely talking now overnight, I know it's life but this shit hurts more than anything."
"Someone confessed but idk how to reply nicely and appreciative, what should I reply?"
"This mans and i have been together since January 5, 2021. At first we were having issues because his family didn't like me being with him and all I could do was be there for him and support his decision but now he's finally said screw them and their opinion because he'd rather have me in his life then have them affect our relationship negativity. He's officially said no more bs and that he wants me, no one else. The cherry on top is that we'll be adopting a little black kitten together. I honestly can't wait to spend the rest of my life with him he's always been there for me when I needed it the most he's sweet and caring. I couldn't ask for anything more."

Love can be so hard to see. Especially when you are in pain. When your heart feels it’s been pulled…hurt and strained. He used all the arrows against me. And every one of them so strong. But the pain was a reminder to keep going. To Always be strong. Sometimes we don’t always feel that strength. But it’s there if you look again🥰💕. I want you to be brave. To be strong. Even if you need a hand💕. Many times we have suffered. It feels almost unreal. But love is there to comfort us. To let us grow and to heal. If you’ve never felt that love. That’s ok too😊💕. If you ever need that loving heart? Call on me and I will be there for you. A girl like me? Chooses to believe💕. No matter the painful experiences received. I have known many. Lots of you have too. But know that a caring heart exists. 🥰and this one will always be there for you. 


We all want to be loved. Very much so. 💕💕Sometimes we have to wait. It’s not always easy. But I want us all to be always encouraged as we wait well too.😊😊💕"
"Hello 👋 so I’m in a bit of a situation and figured I’d ask some people what they think I should do. I’m in love with a girl I’ve been friends with for 4 years now. I’ve told her about my feelings and sadly she doesn’t feel the same way but we’ve remained good friends. However I still have really strong feelings for her, I’ve never felt the way I do about her for anyone else and anytime I’m thinking about trying to find someone else my kind snaps back to her and how perfect she is to me. It’s like no matter what I do I’m constantly wanting to be with her, I feel like she’s THE ONE, she makes me feel like everything is gunna be okay. She’s currently in a complicated relationship with another guy and we’re still really good friends. I’m not really sure what to do. Should I wait to see if things change ? Or should I give up ?"

Hi Redditor! I’m a 21 years M and I have a new girlfriend (18F). We’re together now for just one month so it’s very new.  She’s never been in a relationship before and sometime I feel like she’s considering me just a her friend because she doesn’t make any affection move or any type of compliment. She said she’s independent girl type ( that’s not a problem for me because I am to ) but I feel like it’s more than that. Like she said that I’m the first she ever love because she never been with someone before, but she never show it. She always busy we see each other one time a week if we are lucky. She text me like 2-3 time a day and when I show her my love she say I’m being simp. I feel like she’s not even into me even she say the opposite. I know it’s new for her and maybe she’s just shy or somethings but I just find this lame that my GF doesn’t put us and or relationship in priority in her life. 
Am I overreacting or it is weird? I just don’t want to be heartbroken over this so tell me in comment what you think about this.
Thanks you for reading!"
"I have had one of the worst experiences in relationships, always obsessing over people. This girl I met about in March-April, she's just...so good. She's exactly the logician I would want, the person who respects everyone, someone who's patient and understands my traumas. 
I feel something's different, I don't know what love is but with her I feel like I'm at home, it's exactly that kinda comfort. I don't obsess over her, I think. It's not the clingy/sticky situation where you wanna text someone all the time, it's more of a sense of freedom, even when the conversation dies out, it's not an awkward silence, it's more of a comfortable silence. It feels comfortable to have her around, and if we drift apart, it's not like everything's tearing apart, but I just pray for things to get back to normal as soon as possible and there's a slight discomfort..like when your heart feels heavy just before an interview? Kind of that.

I don't know what the future holds but I hope this turns to something beautiful and very stable. I think I love her, I've never really felt love so I don't know what it's like..but I'm happy and comfortable with someone so much, for the first time. Being with her, I almost got over all my insecurities, traumas, past fears and..found a love for myself as well that I never knew existed. It's just so motivating. 
I can't tell her this right now, I found this subreddit so..thank you for reading how I feel haha. ♡

Also, how do you overcome fear of rejection xd"
"This happened in October 2014, I was 15 then. I'm 22 now. This was back when I was religious (I'm agnostic today). 

My brother and I went to this church that had a separate building for the middle and high scores students. To pass the time while waiting for the sermon to begin, my brother and I threw a football together. Nothing special really. I then decided to throw the ball really far and told him to catch it. But I realized I threw it too far and saw it was going to hit the back of a girl who was facing her friends and away from me. I shouted, ""Look out!"" But it hit her back and I got nervous immediately thinking she was going to be really mad at me. Turns out, she was really forgiving. She was laughing and had a huge smile on her face. She walked up to me with her arms at a 45° angle and asked for a hug. I accepted it.

We wrapped our arms around each other and I felt so cozy in her arms. She even whispered ""I love you."" to me even though we don't know each other. I said to her, ""I love you, too."" I love the way she felt in my arms and the scent her hair gave off. I felt like I could fall asleep in her arms with my chin resting in top of her shoulder. I wanted it to last forever. I felt more cozy as time went on. Although eventually, my arms were starting to get tired. So I let go. I really hope I made her feel so special and loved while she was in my arms. Like someone actually cares for her and will be there to save her from all her worldly problems. 

Once we let go, she shook my hand and tried to get to know me better. I was too shy and awkward to do this. Which my shyness was amplified when she introduced me to her other girl friends. I have a feeling that if it happened today, maybe I'd actually get to know her better and her girl friends rather than seeing her once and never again.

To this day, I look back on that hug with incredible nostalgia. I legitimately want to relive it. It truly set the golden standard to me what an amazing hug feels like. By the time I get a girlfriend, I want to express my love to her by giving her the most amazing hug she'll ever experience in her life. 

Thanks for reading."

"In my experience, it almost seems like there is a correlation the level of brilliance in a certain type of person and the intensity (or insanity) of someone’s obsession. Not always of course, maybe not even often. And I know you will all think it’s just a stereotype and I mean it is, in that it lumps people together and makes assumption about them as a whole. But that mean there is no truth to it. 

I could be wrong of course but I’ve seen it myself too many times. It’s bizarre too because this kind infatuation is associated with youth, foolishness and ignorance, etc. and yet so many of the deepest thinkers, who saw better than anyone the follies and illusions of man, who devoted their lives to understanding and expressing human nature, have pined pitifully after a romanticized illusion, sometimes for years and years, rejecting everything and everyone else, making fools of themselves. But the dominant message in everything I’ve ever read about love is to “reject illusions, don’t fall for the myth of ‘the one,’ you don’t need fireworks right away, infatuation isn’t love, etc.”) Petrarch, Mary Wollstonecraft, WB Yeats, Emily Dickinson, Charlotte Bronte, Proust, etc. And in my personal life the two most creative and brilliant people I know personally have also been the two people I know who had the most extreme, debilitating unrequited romantic obsessions."
" Let me start by saying that I've always been a sucker for romance in media. Ever since I was a 4 year old watching Winx club, I'd always watch it with excitement. I even had a ""fiance"" as a 5 year old (he was just a friend, but I wanted to be like one of those cartoon characters who seemed to have everything).

However, something is off.

In third grade, everyone loved sharing their crushes and I just never felt that. People would always go up to me and say ""ooh I bet you have a crush on \[insert popular boy's name\]"" and I just felt weird and yucky. This wasn't really abnormal since I was 8-9. At 10, I had a conversation with my parents and grandparents about relationships. I swore that I wouldn't get a boyfriend till I was at least 18, and they laughed and said that I wouldn't be too happy about that later.

When 6th grade started, everyone seemed to start puberty. They would date, openly share crushes, and even talk about sex. At this point, I began to lie. Every time someone asked, I would say the name of a random boy in our grade who was semi-attractive and semi-popular. I was a very convincing liar because I always had the tendency to blush, look down, and giggle whenever I lied. At 12, I came clean to one of my friends and she said something devastating:

""Maybe you'll never be able to love lmaoooooo.""

I got super mad and made her apologize at least 5 times, but I think that deep down I was scared that she was right. Desperate, I continued to lie throughout middle school.

Come highschool, everyone started to get into serious relationships and started having sex. I was no longer bothered, and just told everyone that I was uninterested in dating. I would avidly listen to everyone's gossip about their love lives, watch and read books with fluff and smut, and even watch porn. However, something was wrong. For starters, I got h\*rny but never felt ""lust."" Secondly, I wouldn't mast\*rbate (and even if I did, I never had anyone to think about). I was actually happy about not being distracted so that I could focus on my school work.

I'm now a senior in high school and recently turned 18. I'm not really bothered by my lack of attraction anymore since I don't desire a relationship, but I am a bit worried. I know I'm not a sociopath and I know that I am completely mentally healthy otherwise, but isn't it weird that I'm an adult and haven't even had a crush? Will I remain this way for life, or am I some sort of super-late bloomer? Has anyone else had similar experiences?

TL;DR: Though I enjoy romance/sex in media, I am 18 and have never had even the smallest crush."
" 

I've been talking to this guy long distance for a year--- been friends for the last 3 years. He's NEVER had a girlfriend (he's 30, I'm 27). It's been a slow journey for us both. We both struggle with depression and trauma. But, I honestly feel myself falling for him and I think he's starting to feel the same. The other day he made a comment like, ""I can't believe I like talking to you AND I also like fucking you."" That's never happened to him before. He's genuinely surprised at his feelings for me. He's only ever seen women as sexual objects. I'm the first woman he's ever respected and also been attracted to.

Our love story is kinda warped and weird, but I think he's starting to realize what love is, and sometimes it truly is out of our control. I like to think I'm helping him heal.

Only positive vibes please. Just wanted to say I'm living a very interesting love story. I really want this man to feel love and realize how amazing he is. I love helping him heal and realize and feel things about himself that he's never felt before. I fly across the country to see him next week. I can't wait."
"I'm 17 years old. I have read numerous articles, blogs, watched videos on how they can't forget their first love, and how it was the greatest, and will never experience the same. It is my only insecurity maybe you could get me through, I would really appreciate it."

"I was taking part in this game quiz with random witty people and this Danish lady with a big bosom kept trying to flirt/make out with me. It was kind of embarrassing and creepy (but also very exciting).

Then I woke up (damn!).

What do you think it means?"
"They respect each other's relationship boundaries like cutting contacts when both are in a relationship, things like that.. but.. there were some things that has happened before.. they also act as rebounds for each other in the past.

However, I came to know that before the start of our relationship, he once said that if his best friend ever wanted my partner as a legitimate bf, that he'd go to her in a heartbeat.. 
(This was told to me honestly by him) but he said that if it were to truly happen one day, but him and I are still in a relationship, he'd reject even meeting up with her¿

I want to know how anyone else would feel about these, and whether you'd be okay with it and how!?"
"What if he said that it was because at that point of our relationship, it was just the start of the dating phase, and that nothing is confirmed yet?

But now that the relationship is official, he won't give any chances to the girl if we are still together. That is if the girl were to one day come to find him.."
"Good morning and happy Thursday! It’s almost Friday so hang in there! I hope you all have a terrific and productive day! Please send me any prayer requests if you all need anything! Be a blessing and encouragement to others around you today, you never know what someone is going through! 

“For God hath not given us the spirit of fear; but of power, and of love, and of a sound mind. Be not thou therefore ashamed of the testimony of our Lord, nor of me his prisoner: but be thou partaker of the afflictions of the gospel according to the power of God; Who hath saved us, and called us with an holy calling, not according to our works, but according to his own purpose and grace, which was given us in Christ Jesus before the world began,”

"When you're young you just want to love and be loved... and oh God, how often do our hearts get broken.. But we pick ourselves up, gather the shards of our broken heart, stick them together and find someone else and say ""This is my heart, it is not as new as it was, it's a little the worse for wear. But it's my heart, and I believe on the right to love and be loved and I hope you do too""
And, sometimes, they look at you and say ""Yes, and here is mine"".
I first married when I was young, far too young, but from a violent and abusive family... and I wanted to love and be loved. Not being used to it, I wasn't very good at it and was doubtless shallow and needy and insecure. By the end of my second marriage I noticed a problem, I didn't like myself very well and didn't think I deserved to be loved, so I accepted the scraps that were thrown my way.
Finally, at 47, I met someone who gave as much of their heart as I gave of mine. It was like a ship struggling through a storm to a safe harbour. It was like a harp being struck in perfect silence... it was finding the other half of yourself, the bit you didn't even know was missing, and saying 'there you are!, how I missed you!'. I have had the happiest 10 years of my life, we will be together until we die and the only reason I hope that there's a heaven is so that we are there together again. 
So, don't stress too much, don't try to get from a relationship what isn't there. You won't get water from a dry well. Never ever ever accept less than you deserve, never accept the slights or the hurt hoping things will get better... they won't. Give the universe time, give yourself time, learn to like yourself and listen in silence.. it will happen."
"Know what

It's okay, I'm okay (I'm gonna be okay)
I'm happy for you (I'm going to be happy for you)

I've seen this coming I just didn't come up with a plan how to handle this (I've seen this coming I'm just tangled up in you I got blinded so I didn't plan what to do)

I've grown a liking in you as a friend (I've grown a liking in you more than a friend and I wanted it to stay that way)

You've found love and it's not me (I found love in you but you didn't choose me)

I'm hurt (I'm still hurting)

I'm not ready to be your friend right now (I'm not ready to be your friend any longer)
