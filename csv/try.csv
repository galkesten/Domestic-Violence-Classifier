"I’ve been thinking more about self harm. When I find it hard to sleep I think about the box cutter in my drawer next to my bed and I like to imagine cutting myself. 

Thinking about things like how I could make a show out of me dying and I can make it all dramatic and saddening and eventful and make the people who knew me hurt even if it’s only for a little bit and they’ll forget me and live normally like I never existed. I’ve had these thoughts for years but they’ve gotten more realistic lately.

I haven’t done anything yet because I’m a coward, but it just keeps coming to mind. It’s not even out of a huge hatred for myself or others. I don’t even hate my life, but I’ve just felt like nothing matters and nothing will ever matter for me. I don’t hate anyone or myself. I just think I don’t matter. There’s no point to any of this.

I don’t think I’ll be dead soon. Or even hurt in any way. I hate pain. But if anyone has something interesting or life changing to say I wanna hear it. I want something to matter before it’s too late"
"I honestly don’t want closure or anything. I’m going to do it. I guess I want someone to know. 




Just kidding. Made you click. Eat it. F you"
"My girlfriend is suicidal and i just want to help , i don’t know what to do , where to start , but we’ve been dating for almost 2 years , i show her every amount of love and support i can and always listen and be there for her but she says its pointless. She is it doesnt matter what i say cause shes tired of living and im not even worth living for, i just want to be able to talk her out of it as best as i can but it seems shes thought of everything and still wants to kill herself. Shes stubborn and in this case its a bad thing, and i just i could change her mind but then she says, “its my choice.” And i dont even know what to do , we had plans for the future, i was going to get her a promise ring this winter"
I can't sleep. I am constantly sick to my stomach. My fucking ribs are broken. Every time I close my eyes I face the man who abused me for weeks. My life now is fear and that's it. That's all that I have in my life. Why would I want to live in fear forever? I can't take this
"Anyone else feel like that it's going to end one of two ways? Old, alone, full of regrets. The only accomplishment to your name that you served some kind of cosmic penance. That or giving in and blowing your own brains out the way you've always visualized. Maybe writing a note for someone. Idk personally I'm really starting to lean one way. I'm just tired."
"I'm a monster, I need to say it somewhere and online where no one knows me seems like the best way, I heard voices for 7 years of my life I fear every day they'll come back I cant preform basic things others find easy and all I want is to hurt others and to feel pain myself. I want to die to never have to worry about hurting anyone ever again but it dosent feel right, I'm trying to be good, I may be bad deep down but if I never act on it maybe I can help others. But it hurts i cant keep a job cause I'll pass out or feel nothing but pain till I'm away from everything, I just feel like a useless piece of shit, maybe I'm autistic would that just make me more faulty, I've started having cuts pop up on my body I dont even remember doing it I've never been a cutter. Maybe I wou I dont know. My parents hate me. Why am I like this why am I not normal. I dont want to take pills that's not really me it's a fake."

i want to swallow the whole bottle of bleach. i wanna slit my neck open. i hate this so much i hate it i hate it I FUCKING HATE MY LIFE WHY CANT I BE A NORMAL HUMAN BEING???????? IO CANT I HANDLE THIS ANYMORE. THIS IS FUCKING IT. MY LAST GODDAMN FUCKING MESSAGE BEFORE MY FUCKING DEATH.
"We need to stop pretending like it will. Playing the distraction game to kill the time until the universe decides to deal us out a new hand isnt a sustainable idea. Odds are good that if we dont choose to get better, dont choose to alter the path were on in favor of ourselves, that these lives we lead full of pain and regret will continue the way they've been heading. (A downward spiral.) We get on average 75 years on this planet. That's it. It's time to decide for ourselves what is worth our attention. Decide what's worthwhile to you, what in life is worth the time and effort you would use to accomplish the goals you want to achieve. What actions can you engage in that would truly give you a sense of fulfillment based on your principles and morals, instead of based on what's good for your wallet or your social standing. We all want to be loved, but it's hard to love someone who hates themself. Make the choice to improve yourself, it's possible to change the people we are"
"How not to kill myself, from today I'll be alone again in my apartment. Can't be around people, they either hurt me too much or I'm too depressing to them, that means not talking to anyone. Live in a small town with nothing to do. I don't plan on really eating either. Should I just sleep? Thanks."
So fucking done
"I’ve had suicidal thoughts for most of my life and I assume like many other people, I never really talked to anybody about it. I gave some hints here and there over the years, but most of it was brushed off so for a long time I just thought it was normal. I never actually attempted anything, but I planned a lot of it and started making a draft for my suicide letters. I promised myself that I wouldn’t actually do anything until I finished them, but always broke down as I wrote those so they never got finished. 

Most of this happened in middle school and high school. I’m now in my last term of college about to get my bachelors. I’ve gotten a lot better over the years, but I can feel myself slipping more and more over this last year or so. 

Ive just spent the last couple days disassociating in bed and I’m sure everyone just thinks I’m being a flake, and I guess I am, but I’m just trying to make sure I don’t slip back to where I use to be. Like I don’t have time to deal with this, I’m in my last freaking term, but I feel like I’m getting closer and closer to the edge of a meltdown. I don’t know. I don’t want to die. I just feel so lost right now and death just sounds so heartbreakingly sweet."
I have enough goodies to play santa claus but no reindeer came my way so slay me and maybe I'll have a good day
"Every single thing that has happend to me since childhood has caused me PAIN. 

I believe everytime that things will change for better but they end up hurting me the most. And the worst part is I cannot even kill myself bc I would put my parents in depression. Why do I have to witness all this pain with no where to go. If there is anyone as said God, please for once, please take me away. I have waited for you to bring the magical change in life only to realize everything I ever gotten so far is also going to cause me pain for eternity. Please take me away!"
"Im just. This isnt a feeling at all. I just feel so out of body. I fucking hate it. No creativity, no comfort. I feel so weak and empty and just alone. Im sad I have nothing in me to create or interact or anything. I cant even write. I cant make a poem too. Or draw. I hate it"

"I have flirted with the concept of suicide for most of my life. I have even experienced brief bouts of ""suicidal ideation"" all which manifested themselves in response to something or someone. All brashly reactionary. And if I'm being radically honest with myself, I believe I would've been too scared to actually follow through with the act, had I a means of ending it during those very brief stints. As silly as this sounds, it helped a lot that I saw myself as... real. I was a real person. Like, I was [full name redacted]. I had hobbies. I had talents. I had upcoming trips on my calendar. I had obligations which I actually excelled at showing up for. I had the makings of a future. There were people who were active in my life and I in theirs. I didn't hate myself. I was actually an alright person for a minute there...

Oh but ☑︎being talented and ☑︎having hobbies &amp; ☑︎having a supportive circle of people who value me as much as I do, them, etc... Sure. Those things should absolutely *not* be taken for granted— but of course that's not the same as being mandatory prerequisites in order to have a future worth living to see to it's natural end. 

But then, as it always does, stuff happened: life happened.. and blah blah blah. Still though, I suppose I shouldn't use the phrasing ""-but then,"" since I was just about the same as before with regard to how I thought about the topic of suicide. It was merely something I tried to understand but could not, for the simple fact that I was not actually a suicidal person; thus there existed a mental block of sorts preventing my mind from fully “going there” and grasping the concept to my satisfaction.

**Now fast forward to... Lately.** I... must have crossed a line of sorts somewhere, somehow. I know this because, when I come across the subject of suicide in any context &amp; by anyone, it's not fear or unease that surfaces within me (at least not initially, these emotions do come up though in response to my lack of being afraid of the act of suicide)—it's also not even innocent introspection, pondering about when my husband committed it a decade ago— no.. instead I experience an anticipatory... excitement? It's very similar to that feeling you get when you're underwater and you know that you'll be able to come up for air soon, but not just yet. It's frenzied eagerness for relief.. I guess even at the cost of yanking a steering wheel, or finding a vein to pump a lethal amount of opioids into.

"Just walking next to a Lake with people kayaking.
I'd love to do it and I remember the time my 7 year older friend (I was 14 though) and I went kayaking and it was loads of fun. But since then  I haven't found and Single Person who wants to these kinds of things with me.
Makes me feel sad to watch."
"I woke up again today. At first I felt really nice, but then I understand for what I am really devastated and I am  really f*cking sad. I just dont want to live anymore. I love this girl so much and I can't accept my rejection because she want another guy. I need something to cheer me up not like a friend, booze, a doctor but someone to really say to me that she love me, to give a hug, to cry someone who really loves me for what I am"
"News flash, it does not. I tried attempting suicide in September 2020 and I remember waking up in the A&amp;E crying my eyes out, telling the doctors why did I have to wake up when I was finally at peace. The doctors hardly cared, they just told me to 'move on' and said things like 'so THAT'S why you're killing yourself?' and invalidated my emotions and struggles since I was a child. 

It's July 2021 and I still wish I never woke up. All my friends ended up cutting ties with me, my own family keeps hitting me and telling me they give up on taking care of me because I'm a lost cause. My mother has still refused to talk to me and plans to send me to an asylum because she does not want any responsibility of me anymore. And that's when I calmed down. I calmed down because I have nothing else to lose and I truly do not have to worry about anymore what ifs. This is it. I finally stopped crying because I finally made up my mind and I feel so at peace with it."

"I do not condone, so please don't do that, but cutting myself and my soon-to-be suicide had made me feel in control again. I was deeply hurt, angry and upset over a thing I didn't want to see and hurtful words from a dear person (I knew I was wrong, but seeing how harsh they words were, I realized that I should get rid of myself).

So I hurt myself and it felt so fucking good. I could only focus on the physical pain instead of my emotional pain and hurt feelings, the blood coming out of It. Then it came the shame and regret, but still they were better than my original feelings. I can see why people get addicted to it. Anyway, my self harm won't fix the disgrace I am, so all it turns back to killing myself. And I won't give up now.

I pretty much want to say sorry to all I hurt, but I doubt people who I hurt will read that. And I am really thankful for the good moments the people I love gave me, but they are just a little ray of sunshine in what could be considered a tempest. I pretty much stopped caring about anything, so I now I have to destroy the fucking failure I am. The only thing that keeps me on is the deep regret of not ending things earlier, especially after losing everything. Goodbye.

I just wish I wasn't an unloveable, worthless freak that hurts people and no ones cares for."
"I purchased a gun a couple weeks ago with the intent of  planting a round in my head. Today marked the end of the 10 day waiting period,  and the approval of the background check. I raced over to pick it up this morning, and for the first time in awhile,  I felt strangely relieved and at peace knowing come nightfall my plans would be carried to fruition. Tbh I thought I would've done it by now.  I tried to write my goodbyes to the few loved ones I care about,  but the words continue to elude me.  Now I'm stuck surfing this sub, racking the slide,  pressing the cold steel to my temple, and pulling, and repeating.  The mag is in my other hand, I keep loading and unloading it. Im just a few more steps away. I hate now that I'm in the final stretch, I feel riddled with fear, doubt,  and hesitation. But I guess it's inevitable.  If it was that easy to override our basic survival instinct, half of us wouldn't still be on this thread. Oh well, even if I don't overcome it tonight,  at least I've secured the means for my end, I'm sure it won't be too much longer."
"It just makes me want to kill myself. They just say you should be more grateful that you have a roof over your head and everything like that. All it does is invalidates people's feelings. People treat you like you're too emotional, too negative, and ungrateful. People are against people like me. They don't like you. I'm just going to kill myself if people treat me like this."
The amount of people that want to kill themselves over one single person. I believe in your right to choose when to end your life (as long as you are making the decision willingly and are of sound mind)  but wanting to kill yourself because one person doesnt like you anymore... it seems beyond trivial to me. The kind of unstable personality that would choose to do this doesnt have the mental depth required to make the decision to kill themselves. Give it a little time before you jump straight to wanting to die. I need an 25+ version of this I think.
"I want to sleep forever - when I'm asleep my mind isn't there my selfish issues aren't there - I just feel so much better being asleep w/ no dream, no nothing - Sometimes it just such a burden to be awoken to myself despite having the pleasure to see kind, beautiful ppl around me. I tried yesterday to slip by my household by going out the back window and they have cameras but they are leaving soon so today's the day I meet my fate at the bridge I've known my path ends at.

I love and appreciate all the effort you guys do for everyone. I hope you guys find peace too."
"ppl always said that theyre giving you virtual hugs when you got sad, and while i appreciate that, all i need is just hug, right here right now, bone crushing hug that will heal all of my wound .. is that really too much to ask ?

"I’m starting my junior year of high school this year and I’m not really too excited about it. my freshman year was pure fucking hell!! my sophomore year was alright though because of COVID and had to do online classes..for 3/4 of my freshman year the anxiety was too unbearable that I skipped class and went straight to the bathroom for all 8 periods. my anxiety is like this my heart starts beating fast, I can’t walk straight, my eyes start to get droopy, etc, I asked my mom and dad if I can do homeschooling but they declined FUCK. I only have like 1 month left until school starts and I’m really considering suicide, I’ve been thinking about suicide everyday for a couple of months now, nobody in my family knows that I have a big anxiety disorder thing and I’m depressed out of my fucking mind, because of this fucking anxiety thing god gave me..because of this thing god gave me I’ve forgotten all my skills and all the things that made me unique, I’m just nothing, if I’m planning do commit suicide I would want a slow death like bleeding myself out. I would also love someone to beat the shit out of me until I’m dead but nobody would want to do that to me. this is only a small percent of what I experience. my emotions are not reaI, I have fake emotions, it feels like god is playing with my fucking mind, I just want to have real emotions, but depression and anxiety are the 2 only really emotions I can feel"
"When I was 16, I attempted suicide. I thought life couldn’t get any worse than it was back then. 

I decided to help others if I couldn’t help myself and started working for a suicide prevention crisis support line two years ago - I sat with people in their darkest moments trying to help them see hope. 

Now, I’m having debilitating thoughts of suicide and seriously considering trying to end my life again. However, I have someone relying on me now and I don’t want to pass on the pain to my newborn. It would be awful to grow up knowing your parent suicided a few months after you were born. 

I’ve tried seeking help, I’ve seen four different professionals and it’s just not working. I don’t even know why I’m posting, I’m just lost and struggling."

I am Proud of YOU  
 you struggle, like we all do with thoughts of suicide and or dying or harming ourselfs to get through the day, you are not weak for thinking about it, you are not weak for considering it, you are STRONG for still being here, you are STRONG for still hanging on and though i dont know you or what you are dealing with, i dont know if there is a chance for it to get better one day or not but i hope it does, i hope you all find that happiness that makes you hang on for just a day longer, and then again tomorrow and the day after. many people wouldve probably broken if they went through what you are going through right now so be proud that you have made it so far, and even if you are not  
i am proud of you regardless"

In my case suicide is not a “permanent solution to a temporary problem” because my problem is that I hate life and that is never going to change so, suicide is a permanent solution to a permanent problem for me. Suicide is the only thing that will fix my problem and give me peace."

"I'm sorry to post this to other people dealing with suicidal thoughts, I never want to seem like I think that's the best option for ANYONE even myself.

I am Bipolar and have struggled with suicidal thoughts since I was a young child (I am now in my early 20's) Initially a lot of childhood abuse and poor living conditions contributed to a feeling of deep sadness and depression... That being said as the years have gone by, I've started to realize that my suicidal thoughts have very little to do with being sad and much with a lack of desire to be alive and a dislike for the things that happen in this world.

I used to write it off because I had people, things, and plans in my life that mattered. But after going through a divorce I've come to realize that most every person in my life has left, and Its made me realize I that it does not matter if I die and hurt anyone to me. If someone is hurt by my passing, it has no impact on me if I am deceased.

I do not care for my original career plans, I do not want to have children, and I do not care about hurting people by passing.

Has anyone else realized that their suicidal thought have nothing to do with sadness or even depression or hatred for yourself, but just a hatred for the world you live in?

Not sure if this is the wrong place for this, I'm sorry if it's triggering to anyone, I just want to talk about this because I feel lost in other support groups I've talked to."

Well there is hope out there or i got extremely lucky.

I know money isn't everything but we all need it to have a better life and improve ourselves.

"Hey guys, I live in UK. I have harm OCD, which basically means I've had intrusive thoughts to harm/kill myself and others my whole life. I've always struggled trying to get help because OCD is so misunderstood. Like when you go to the Dr and say you need mental health help. They ask you ""are you a risk of harm to yourself or others?"" Or something along those lines. And before you even answer, they say ""because if you are, I will have to report it"". I find these questions really difficult because, A. I've been suicidal my whole life, I have self harmed my whole life and I've had intrusive thought to hurt others my whole life. At certain points I have very bad breakdowns where I feel like I might actually act on these intrusive thoughts. But if I told a Dr how I really felt, I would be sectioned, which I know would make everything a lot worse for me. So I say no, I'm not at risk, I'm not suicidal. And then you get no help at all and they don't help you as urgently as you need it. So I was just wondering how many people have been really suicidal, but lied to Doctor's out of fear of being held against their will (sectioned)?"

They’ll turn their back on me when I need them or laugh at me or throw my struggles in my face but when I manage to pull myself out of a dark place they enjoy being there like they did something. I don’t even know why I was worried. I guess because I feel empathy for them because I know what it feels like to not have anyone care but whatever. 

I don’t really have anything left. I tried hobbies and making friends but I don’t have the patience or energy to maintain them. I don’t like or feel connected with people and whatever people I have in my life I’m definitely the least favorite and least liked. I hate school, I hate my program. I can no longer find joy in the little things like music or food. I’ve tried therapy, multiple therapists and either they are too expensive or they’re not good. I tried to joint a program where I feel like I’d be around more caring people just to feel a community and have someone who sees the world similarly to me but that also backfired. There’s just nothing keeping me here anymore. I’m gonna go read and finish the policy and start planning."
"I wanna die, I wanna die, I wanna die, this hurts so bad, everything seems to be beyond damaged. The disease (depression) has ruined me in so many ways, I just wanna go."
"I self harmed with the intent of ending my life last night. I tried to cut some of my blood vessels open, but my scissors weren’t sharp enough. I ended up bleeding down my leg but it stopped after a few minutes. I probably lost about 10-15 mL of blood. Does this count as a suicide attempt, or is this suicidal self harm?

Thank you for any input in advance. I love you all, and know that you’re all beautiful people.

"People talk about the morality of killing yourself, of the pain you leave behind for those that love you. They talk about religious implications, and of the pain of different methods of suicide.  They talk about the regret of not being able to achieve your goals in life if you're dead,  as if my ten year plan would matter at all to my corpse. But none of that is why I'm still here, positive or negative, it doesnt inform my decision. I'm here because of the terror of waking up in the hospital the morning after my ""attempt at self harm."" The fear that in by trying to end the pain of life I will make my situation that much worse. Unable to use my hands because I slashed through my tendons? Unable to speak or control simple motor functions because of the brain damage from lack of oxygen? Paralyzed or comatose, or with a giant crater in my head from a bullet that just couldn't quite get the job done? Did you know that suicide by shooting yourself in the head only has an 82% chance of succeeding? Scariest fact I've learned in a while. Fear of Failure, that's what's keeping me on my feet today. But theres always tomorrow."
I'm starting to do self harm again. I even bought a small cutter so when i feel stressed i can do self harm. If I can't die then self harm should be enough for now.
"You spend all this money for them to just not address your problems. Fuck you if you do this as a therapist. ASK US TO BE HONEST BECAUSE YOU WANT TO HELP. NOT BECAUSE YOU’RE BEING PAID. Have some fucking empathy for once. Even things like asking to talk about something else throws them into a loop of “well what’s wrong with what we’re talking about??” It’s called I don’t care about what we’re talking about because it’s wasting time and my money for the help I was promised but don’t get. 

TL;DR: It you’re a therapist, actually care about your patients. Not the paycheck."
"So I'm not going to kill myself now. I could easily, because I secured the means a long time ago when I wanted to die more urgently than now. But once both my cat and my dad are gone I'll shoot myself. I don't want to burden my dad with my suicide and my cat needs me. Part of me wishes I was dying from something out of my control. Like a disease."
"I like this subreddit, it's like a confession box for sad people. Like me. 
I hate how good I am at hiding my sadness from others. Everyone thinks I'm fine, but sometimes all I do is stay in bed all day and sleep, and think about the bridge close to my house and how easy it would be to step off into the churning murky waters below. And I self harm  and sometimes I think my sadness has stolen most of the space people have for a personality. Because I am mostly just a paper thin sheet of a person, billowing and blowing away at the seams, where others are 3D and oozing with personality. 
In all, I feel hallow. Unreal. Like I'm on a dusty shelf just waiting, waiting for something that won't come. Ever. And I think more and more about stepping off that bridge one day.."
"I've felt suicidal since I was about 12 years old. Emotionally abusive parents, absentee father and mother while I lived with my grandmother who was the emotionally abusive one. I met my wife in my 3rd year in high-school and we started dating in senior year. We were both awkward and she was my first real girlfriend outside of long distance ones that also didn't end well. We have changed as people throuout the 12 years we have been together and mostly for the good, growing in empathy and ability to communicate. One thing that didn't grow was my self esteem. I can see objectively I'm not particularly ugly or anything and I have a few skills but nothing has really added to my self worth. My wife was my primary source of confidence. Last week I had found out that she had been involved with someone via the internet. This has destroyed me and even though she has cut contact and been saying and doing a lot of the right things so that we can stay together. She was a major anchor for me to this world and now I feel like its really just not meant for me. I've told her before  that I never thought I'd make it this far and right now my feet are dragging. I guess I'm just venting as I work out where I go from here. I have had some good moments with my wife since this but I still feel like the life is be drained out of me. I know that plenty of you have it worse and plenty of people would not have their wayward spouse show remorse. For that I feel selfish, but honestly everything feels selfish when you feel like you deserve nothing but death."
"
I took 75 pills 3 hours ago and nothing has happened to me, I’m very furious. I’m also scared of what’s about to happen to me. I feel nothing but I’m prepared to what’s to come. Wish me luck 🙂"

"When I was a child I was forced to wear clothes too big which still don't fit me. I haven't grown in them. The only life experience I gained from it was knowing how to act as a grown up. Tonight I'll be 19 and next year I won't be a teenager anymore. The thought that I will never have properly actualized my own potential consumes me, to an extent that I'm ready to pull the trigger. I'm thinking of ending things but I won't because my mom is dependent on me."
"I feel tired. 
Why am i still alive. 
I don’t have anything major that is objectively bad going on really.
But why do i still feel this way."
Im sacred that I'm either going to do something I'll regret either by killing myself when I've been doing so good or I'm going to accidentally say something that'll lead to me getting put in the ward again to the new nurse I'm meeting. She sounds bitchy and I'm afraid she'd put me in a ward.

"Many many years later, everything is worse and I feel played as fuck. Tricked and deceived by the system. Wtf I was thinking? I knew in my gut that the situation was hopeless (not attractive), but for some retarded reason I decided to keep going... I should have trusted my gut since back then. Fuck people, and fuck society

PS: being smart educated and skilled wont save you. Being fit wont save you. Having money wont save you. And even working hard, wont save you. So yeah fuck all"
I’m going to kill myself in tonight. Have everything set. I want to go but I feel for my family. This will reck them but I’m not set up for life.
Thinking of slitting my wrists and  bleeding out.
Everything is better when I’m asleep. I honestly wish I just don’t wake up later.
"Living life on this Earth is a curse.

I’m so tired of reaching out to get help. Why are people telling me to get help? I don’t think I want to anymore. I don’t see the point in forcing myself to want to live. I’m just so tired. I just want to cease existing."
"Cant even muster the energy to deliver my rant. Which is actually just a series of observations about the realities of living in modern society, feeling unfulfilled with the progression of life, and the brutal ways people treat each other in the name of profit. The same observations I've been making since I was twelve years old. But I guess I dont really need to do that here, we all know more or less exactly the way each of us feels about how life works, it's why we congregate in places like these. People think we're looking for advice, or sympathy, a shoulder to cry on. In some cases that's true but when we've reached the end of what we think we can endure and we are sitting in front of our screen holding a bottle of pills, or that length of rope we've been tying over and over to get just right (wouldn't want it to fail when we need it most) We Know that noone has the words to give us to make it better. That magical set of words that will fit in a character limited text box, and will wipe away all the sorrows and pains of our lives. The miraculous advice given by a stranger that knows nothing of the specifics of our hardships, that will rejuvenate us and show us a new light that will guide us in life. NO. We came here for ourselves. Our last ditch effort, our last vestige of hope that by sharing our stories and our plans and our pains, we can gain the clarity and strength we need to keep struggling through these trials. Or that with the commiseration of those that see the world the way it truly is, we will finally find the courage to end them. I hope you discover, in the process of releasing yourself, the Will that you need to keep on fighting for your life. (Reposted but I just dont know what else I can offer to help this sea of drowning people)"
I HAVE A FUCKING GUN! I HAVE A FUCKING GUN! I HAVE A FUCKING GUN! I HAVE A FUCKING GUN! QUIT SAYING IT'S MY FAULT AND BLAMING ME FOR EVERYTHING AND TREATING ME LUKE SOME OVEREMOTIONAL IRRATIONAL DUMASS!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! I HAVE A FUCKING GUN!!!!!!!!!!!!!
What’s the least messiest way to do this without making it harder on people who may discover you have to clean up ect
"My family won’t suffer for the rest of their lives by having to take care of me, people grieve and get over it all the time. I can’t get or hold down a job, I’m not even disabled enough to get disability pension, I do literally nothing with my life, no aspirations, no religious or spiritual beliefs. The only ‘friend’ I have gets paid to see me. Every single guy I’ve met has used me a then thrown me away, not like I’ve ever been able to hold down a relationship anyway and Im never having kids because my genes are probably fucked. I can’t even take antidepressants without possibly unintentionally severely injuring myself. And to top it off the world sucks, our planet is dying and theirs death and despair everywhere.

I don’t want pity, other people probably have it worse than me. I just want a single reason to live. I wish I had something to live for but I don’t."
whats the easiest and painless way to kill yourself????
"money makes the whole difference in my world. fk people. fk religion. fk family. money is freedom.
