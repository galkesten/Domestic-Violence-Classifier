Can't stop...thinking of you 

and wished everything 

you said to me was true

Reading messages where 

You said you loved me

This life isn’t fair 

Where did it begin when you lied to me

Why did you think you had to hide from me

Did you ever consider being truthful

Cause when you lied, was just being ruthful

I couldn’t help but let the hurt ooze 

To believe you were someone I would lose

Hope you’re happy with what you choose

Finally thinking of picking up some booze 

&amp;#x200B;

Can’t stop...thinking of you

when I do 

All I feel is hate

All I feel is pain

Hope the day comes when memories fade 

And no fragments of you remain...

&amp;#x200B;

I still love you…

I hate that I do... 

Hate to say I wish you misfortune 

But truly wish you love and happiness...

Goodbye."
"So my ex broke up with me because she needed to ""work"" on herself when she had a family crisis and I told her that I'd still be there for her and that no matter what I'm not just gonna leave her side. I later found out she moved on a week later to who I thought was my bestfriend. I found out that they were flirting with eachother the last week we were together and she moved in with her other ex to help raise his kid. I know she was a pos, but I cant get over her and i still would take her back. I just dont want her to get hurt even though she basically spit in my face. Why cant I get over her? This was my first ""actual"" breakup too and that dosent make it better. The whole relationship was me making sure she got the support and help she needed to be happy. We only argued over her exes and her canceling things on short notice alot. I just want to know what I did to deserve it?"
"TL/DR: My ex made me constantly question my reality. Made me think I was some angry intolerable person. And hated the fact I could stick up for myself. Is this emotionally abusive? Or was she trying to wear down my confidence to her level. 


I’m sure you all know, me and my partner split up 15 days ago. We have been NC since. 

Thinking back to the relationship, she never respected my views/beliefs. I really enjoy politics; I don’t care who you vote for, nor will I try to change your views. I respect everyone equally - apart from extremists, obviously. My partner would become extremely irate and disrespectful when I’d talk about my views. She would shut down conversation, say nasty things and hold such prejudice against a certain political persuasion - so did her family. Quite an intolerable bunch who believed they were very accepting. 

If we were out queueing for a restaurant and someone jumped in-front of us, I’d say, “excuse me, sorry, you’ve jumped the queue, please go to the back, we’ve been here for a while”. She would get really annoyed with me and tell me to stop being aggressive. Is that aggressive? I think this is because she wouldn’t speak up if someone did that to her. She would constantly make me question my own reality: Was I rude? Did I really sound aggressive? All of these thoughts would swarm my mind and I would be so upset - I’m a friendly person and wouldn’t blow my top off because someone stepped in front of me. 

In a restaurant, if I ordered steak and received fish, I’d ask the waiter/waitress if they could please return it. Respectfully, obviously. It’s not their fault. My ex would just eat what they were given, even if they didn’t order it. They thought it would be rude/unnecessary to flag down the waiter and bring it back. Again, she would say I’m being aggressive. I’m not sure if she acted that way because she was annoyed that I had the confidence to do that, while she didn’t. I couldn’t really do anything right, in her eyes. 

She would constantly ask me why I’m angry when I wasn’t. She was angry. She projected a lot of her inner feelings onto me. Whenever she felt unsure about us, she would ask if we were OK. I never knew she was having doubts until the last 2/3 weeks of the relationship. 

I feel crazy. I used to (still do) constantly question my behaviour. With me, I’m quite a logical thinker. I won’t say anything until I thought about it. On the other hand, she was an emotional (explosive) thinker. Every action/reaction would be based on her feelings. That’s completely fine, but I can’t help but feel like I’m the toxic one. Maybe she wanted to make me feel that way. 

Thank you for reading this! I would appreciate some advice/thoughts please.

Blessings!!!"

"The amount of pain is unbearable. The breakup happened because he didn't want to hold me back, he didn't want to influence my life decisions or be a bad influence on me. On top of that he has a lot of shit going on with his toxic family and can only just cope with his own mental health through unhealthy coping mechanisms (drink, drugs).

He said that I'm one of the only things that made him happy, that I deserve the world and so much better than him, but I was so happy with how thing were going before I was blindsided. I was finally working in my mental health issues in a way that worked, spending more time to myself and setting myself boundaries. Then this happened and as a result I had to transfer jobs to avoid seeing him all the time, losing the community I'd built there over the past 2 years.

We've hooked up and spoken in the month following it which delayed the healing for sure, so we chatted the other night via video call, confirming that we need to go no contact, despite how much we still care for each other. The pain is too much. I still struggle to understand why this has happened if I made him happy, if I gave him purpose. I can't cope."
"I got dumped the other night. it has destroyed me completely, i haven't cleaned my teeth or eaten or showered in two days. i feel so gross and depressed.  i feel helpless and pathetic and just dont know what to do anymore"
"Good morning and happy Tuesday my beloved friends! I hope you all have a wonderful and productive Tuesday!!! Please send me any prayer requests as you all are dear and special to me! Be a blessing and encouragement to someone in need today! 

“Forasmuch as ye are manifestly declared to be the epistle of Christ ministered by us, written not with ink, but with the Spirit of the living God; not in tables of stone, but in fleshy tables of the heart. And such trust have we through Christ to God-ward: Not that we are sufficient of ourselves to think any thing as of ourselves; but our sufficiency is of God; Who also hath made us able ministers of the new testament; not of the letter, but of the spirit: for the letter killeth, but the spirit giveth life.”

"I have never really dated online, but about a month ago I got a VR headset and decided to play VRchat, I met him 3 weeks ago and at first he was just some random guy whose friend request I accepted and would come join me in whatever world I was in, I had also never heard him before because he was always mute. In some worlds there are ones you can write in with a pencil so I was able to talk to him because he refused to unmute lol. We started talking and he would write back, it was the first time I felt like I've actually enjoyed a conversation with someone in a long time. He confessed his feelings for me, he had never dated online either, it was new to us but it felt so right to me. I would waste sleep and everything just to talk to him, eventually I heard his voice which made me fall even more, not just because of his voice but because I could actually hear his personality and everything, I admired him all the time, he was amazing, we would play chess together and we loved the same music. Sometimes we would get in fights because he just genuinely didn't understand what I meant and would say something dumb, I found out he had aspersers and that's probably why sometimes he just doesn't get the tone and queues, but I have BPD which it's kinda like I have this switch and I can get easily upset, I had already cried in front of him 2 times within a week, which I never do around others. Either way I really wanted things to work with him, I have never felt like this for anyone, I love the way he made me feel. Except I lost him 3 days ago, we were talking about something serious and he couldn't tell I was being serious so he was making a joke out of it and it made me upset so I started to push him away like I always do and he abruptly just sent me a whole paragraph starting with ""our interests aren’t aligned anymore"" and blocked me. I warned him in the beginning I can be really sensitive which he said he understood but I guess it's too much for some people. He blocked me on everything without even letting me reply. I have no way to talk to him, to get closure, to say good bye. I've been going crazy thinking about him, I listen to his Spotify playlist, I re-read our messages every night, I have a voice message of him saying ""miss you"" and I listen to it probably 50 times a day so I guess I am kind of crazy. I'm just in denial at this point, hoping that he'll come back. I'm sure he is just fine now, he said in the goodbye message ""I’m gonna miss everything about you and I’m not gonna know what to do, but the truth is we will both get over it."" it's only been 3 days but I feel like my heart is torn apart, even if we only knew each other for 3 weeks they were at the top in the most crazy and amazing weeks of my life. I'm terrified of forgetting what his voice sounded like. AHHHHHHHHHh"

"Nothing hurts more than knowing you have no right to be hurting
He was never mine to lose
But still all I needed was a little extra time to get out of my current situation and I fell for him hard 

2-3 more weeks he couldn’t have waited for me for that time 

Dancing around each other since college guess he’ll always be my what if guy"
I know my worth but my heart just wants their arms.
It still hurts. It's hard to lose a connection.
"All before 3 years ago started in the time of school when we started to meet eachother &amp; get to know more.we really meant like we are made for eachother. we felt that we have been fell in love with each other but never used to say openly cause it may lead in the distraction,but really we were more than just being couples &amp; hanging out.We stayed to be connected each other only through social media after i left from school.Many late night talks &amp; chat we were so close by our souls.&amp;suddenly
A day turned out to be my nightmare which continues still..I couldnt see her GM wishes morning&amp; no response for my text,no Dp &amp; no about &amp; cannot find her in any social media's..No response for call &amp; i called her close friend to know her &amp;i get to know that she was all fine &amp; tried to talked to her she declined &amp; even tried to meet her but she acted like that am stranger &amp; then started to realize that she has started to ignore me but for no reason that really sucks.we havent stayed even for more than couple of hours not talking to each other even if we had fights that will vanish like nothing when we use the magical word Sorry.

But now it has been a couple of month of waiting that she will come back to me but she hasnt just not even a text.But getting news from everyone that her life goes as usual &amp; she is floading her instagram by post &amp; stories..I really have no idea to what to do after doing all what i can to make her comeback.
Seriously to be open i cant just ignore her &amp; move on as she did.Her thoughts &amp; memories we had together just keeping me hurting &amp; distracting.I have no idea to how to move on as she did..Cause i have no close friends &amp; cousins or anyone to keep me move on or to share.

@tleast some one who sees this have gone through it like am being in it.I kindly request you guys to help me out to get away from this &amp; ur guys experience or some advise &amp; Thanks a lot for ur time."
"The person you are now and and the person you were when you broke up with me is not the same person that I fell in love with. I've heard many people say that the military changes you and makes you see life  differently. And I do believe it's true to some extent. But I don't think this applies to you especially since your job in the military isn't on the front line. You just started showing your true colors. You left me feeling worthless and made me feel like I was never gonna be enough for anyone. You made me feel like I will always be replaceable when I found out you got into a new relationship just a few months after you ended our relationship. 

I noticed that you have never really loved yourself and you seek validation from others. You might think (and I also thought this for a while) that you are doing way better than me because you are in a new relationship and because you are doing better financially than me at the moment. 

But no, I knew that was false. You can have all the money in the world and have all the relationships/hook ups you want, but we both know that money can't buy happiness and as long as you continue to seek validation from others, you will be in an endless cycle of misery. I know I may not have a lot of money and I'm still single (and I think I will be for a while as I'm not desperate to be in a relationship and because I'm very anti social), but I know I never have to seek validation for others because I have always loved myself for who I am.

Now I know that it's not that I was never enough for you, you just never appreciated anything that I've done for you. Because of how I much I missed you, I was tempted to get into the casual dating/hook up scene to fill this void but I resisted because I'm strong and that lead me to know my worth. And I'm no longer gonna let anyone determine my worth for me.

You might say that you're too busy working on yourself to notice if I'm doing better, but we know that's false. We both had to work on ourselves and rushing into a new relationship leaves no room or time to work on self improvement. Im not saying you are the only reason that lead our relationship to failure because I know we both did mistakes. But I actually have the integrity to work on my faults and mistakes because I know that's the right thing to do unlike you. 

Ever since I've been working on myself, I finally knew what exactly are my morals and values. And I realized we don't have the same ones and they're not even close to being similar. I'm glad you put me through all this because it has made me a better person. Ever since you ended things between us, I was hoping that we will eventually date again. But now I'm learning to let go of that hope. My feelings for you have been diminishing more and more. I know that you still have feelings for me no matter what you say or do. Hopefully they will perish soon. And why you may ask? Because this is the end of our chapter and there will never be another one. And I know that because I know deep down that you will never change yours ways. I know I will eventually find someone else that will appreciate my worth. It may take years but that's okay because I know it won't be you. 

Thank you for helping get personal growth and character development."
"Ive been through so many relationships but i never rly felt anything about it when i ended them except for this one. I actually loved her, i fell in love for the first time and now im heartbroken so bad i dont know what to do or what to say. I cried 2 times in my life, one becuz i fell in love with her and now because we broke up. I cried till i canr cry anymore, i feel like my heart is sore im 20yo btw. Now i just wanna know... what if i keep overthinking and crying, will i get over her faster? Like will my brain get bored off of it and then just not care? Cause i dont wanna ""forget her"" i just wanna get over her and be normal again. So when I see her with someone i wouldn't care any less. I dont know what to do 
I dont know why my stupid heart fell in love  in the first place.. i couldnt control it, i think i was pretty sad at that time and my brain somehow tried to make it work by making me fall in love.
I've known her for 4 years n i never thought id love her that way, but i did. And then we were in a relationship for a year. I broke up with her yesterday. I was so extremely mad and sad at the same time when we decided to break up.
I dont know what to do, i wanna escape this world. Im so cold hearted how did i fall in love like that? Google says it takes 11weeks for someone to fall out of love.. thats too long. I got so many things to focus on but i cant.i have to get over it. Give me a cheat code please"

we talked i said my feelings and got shot down. we dated for two years and yeah it got not great near the end which is why we ended things but god i just wish i couldve kept her. i tried to distract myself with someone else and that ultimately just made me feel worse. i talked to my ex and she said not to get my hopes up cause its probably not gonna happen. and i get that but i just miss her man. i let her into every little thing of my life and now i cant even do the things i would normally do to relax anymore without thinking of her. im so helplessly in love with her and i dont know what to do.

I was in an abusive relationship for 6 months. The guy was really toxic and men manipulative. I broke it off with this guy  in early May and a lot of drama was involved.I did ended up losing a lot of people I considered friends. People did warned me to just leave him. I don't want to explain further  the details of that relationship because I think this post will be too long. It did took a toll on me and I became depressed over it. In a about few weeks I was starting to feel better. I decided to download a dating app and see where it goes. 

A lot of guys that were my preference didn't match with me. I did came across a really cute and we both starting getting to know each other. We exchange social media. I think this happened in late June. We had gotten pretty close. Everyday we both fell asleep on the phone with each other and wake up. We played games together. Honestly, I felt like he was everything I asked for. Our birthdays were 5 days apart. I'm 20 and he is 26. He had this bubbly personality that I really liked. I felt a genuine connection with him. I could tell he liked me back. He liked about a hour and thirty minutes from me. Just across the boarder. 

There was a day he had to work all day. I was busy studying. We both try to text each other throughout the day. Right around 7PM I was done studying and I was busy playing games on my phone. He was going home and was probably setting in after work. He texted me at 8:00PM telling me that he just got out of the shower. I saw the text but I was busy playing a game on my phone so I ignored it. After I finished a game match and I open the snap send him a few text messages at 8:25PM. It said my snaps were still pending until he adds me as a friend. I thought he accidentally unfriended me. But I learned how to remove someone as a friend and it most likely wasn't a mistake. I log into my old snap and asked him did he accidentally unfriended me. He said no. I told him I'm going to reset my password on the snap. He said what why. I send him another text. He read it then the chat disappears.

 I felt something was really off. I asked friends to send him messages on his social media asking why block/ghost me for. I wish I just let it go instead of doing that. He asked me to leave him alone. One of my closest friends, she had talk some sense into me. She telling me it's best to leave him alone and maybe try contacting him in a year. I don't want to do that. I knew she was being optimistic for my sake. I'm pretty sure I be in a better mind frame and not thinking about this. I regret deeply what I did to this guy. I wish I just left as it is. I think I blinded by heartbreak and after everything that happened to me. I wasn't thinking things through and I think my mind went blink. 


 I feel so heartbroken. I know a month isn't much but I can't help but get grow to attach to someone. Especially talking /sleeping over the phone for hours. We made plans to meet up in the first week of August. I guess I was so happy to meet someone and forget about a lot of the stuff that happened this year. 

 We planned on getting something to eat then see a movie. I made arrangements to get a passport. I feel embarrassed for doing that. So many questions going through my head rn. I wonder if I responded sooner would he had not done that. What was he thinking/ felt that lead him to do that? I wonder did he mistook me for someone else when I tried talking to him on my old snap. I'm not surprised if he were talking to other people.  I wonder did he choose someone else over me or it was something else. I do believe stuff happens for a reason. But I feel like I lost something major. I been in a lot of similar situations where I ended up by myself. I think maybe it's a sign that I should just focus on myself and just walk away form situations. People don't have to explain to me why they choose to walk out of my life. It was indeed a hard lesson to learn. 


~Questions~

Have you guys did something similar to what I done? 

If you did what's was going through your mind at the time and what made you stop?

 Did someone talk some sense into you?

 What made you get over that person and forgive yourself for what you did? 

Do you know someone who did something similar?

How long it took you to forgive yourself and did that other person forgave you? 

What you did to move on?"
"Ex-partner does not know how she feels about me, she doesn't know what to say whenever I touch on the relationship topic. I am cool tho, trynna not take it personally, but I am a ride or die type of person, however, I am still trying to understand. We broke up a while ago tho. 

I felt some truth in it, but it can also be a “blameless” reason right? Some people are really good at getting away with it. 

She would say stuff: “at least I am not leaving you for another person” or “I thought you were gonna be cool with that” …

Has anyone ever been in that position? (on either side)"

Life is cruel to bring us together knowing we would never be finished without ever beginning.

"I miss you 
You where the first person i ever loved 
Its been 3 months and i still think of you 
I want you back so badly 
I still dont know why you dumped me"
"Hello Everyone. I am new to this reddit thread and I’m just super upset right now and needed somewhere to vent. Basically I was in a dream relationship. I loved this women and our relationship was absolutely perfect. We got along so well and never had any arguments. (I will say she was always there for me and I feel like she didn’t speak up enough for herself which might’ve led me to become to comfortable in our relationship. ) However, over the span of the last month I started wondering what it would be like to be single again and if i was really in the best spot i could be at the current moment. Eventually, In December, I pulled the trigger. She was absolutely devastated but still kept in contact with me as I was very nice about it. She cried and cried for days and I knew about her pain. I was terribly upset as well but I knew I did this for a reason so I always kept busy with my current goals. I was moving a 100 miles a minute and it really kept me distracted for the rest of december (the month i broke up with her) and january. She would tell me I was making a mistake and I would come back to her soon and everything would be okay. As more time went on she started getting better and left for florida around a month after our breakup. We still had contact when she first arrived in florida and it stayed that way for a short while. However, when she started lashing out at me and we started getting into disagreements no contact officially started. She stayed in florida with her friends for almost 2 whole months. The feelings i started getting are still completely unexplainable to myself. I was doing okay for a short while and then when reality set in I realized how stupid I was to leave this girl. After being depressed for weeks I finally reached out to her telling her how i felt. I knew she had been with other guys and I also had been with other women but none of that mattered to me. I wanted her back more then anything. When i reached out to her to tell her how i felt she was rude and told me i hurt her so much and she never wanted to be with me again. When i heard this i beat myself up even more telling myself this was all my fault and she has every right to do this to me. I was desperate and showed my true weaknesses. I was depressed. Around april i slowly started getting better and being able to live without utter sadness but the pain was still there. Up until just a few days ago we were completely no contact for all of april, may, and june. Just the other day, she reached out to me asking how i was doing. Currently i still am not over her and it’s crazy to me. I’m not ready to see her with another guy and i hate myself for taking this long when she is completely over our romance. it has made me feel weak and not capable. We are now texting a little and she has apologized for treating me so harshly before. (i still believe it was my fault and couldn’t bring myself to resent her for how she had treated me.) She has come out and told me she wants to be friends but i still have very strong feelings for her. i can’t find the middle ground. she’s such a cool person and i’d love to be friends with her but i can’t help but wonder what she’s doing when she’s not texting me and where she is at the current moment. I don’t want to see her walk away again and she has told me there is no hope for a relationship again and it’s absolutely terrible. I’m confused, depressed, sad and angry. Anyways, thanks for listening and any comments would be appreciated."
"We had our up and downs and if I’m being honest they were mostly about getting you to acknowledge my feelings. You kept telling me I deserved better but never really made a clear change. What hurts the most is after it all I still love you. You blocked me on everything and want no contact at all for the foreseeable future. Even with this you let some piece of shit into your life who has only done you wrong and put you in danger. You said I will always love you and care. When are you ever going to show it why can’t I give up. Love hurts, I don’t want to feel this anymore I wish I could either forget you or just have the words from your mouth tell me how much of a bad person you are and that you in fact don’t care. None of it makes sense."

"It hurts when the person you fell the hardest for decided to end it with you after 3 years. It hurts even more when he jumps into another relationship after only being single for one month with the girl he used to complain about being so annoying.

I don't know what I did to make him hate me but it feels like whatever it was, I'm being punished for it now. 
You told me you feel like you can't be happy or content in relationships. You told me you weren't looking into having anymore kids or getting married. One month after saying those words, you jump into a relationship with a girl that has a baby. Makes so much sense. I don't know what I did to deserve being lied to instead of just saying you didn't have feelings for me anymore. And it honestly makes me wonder if she was there BEFORE we broke up..or if that was the real reason we did break up. 
I honestly don't think I can take this pain or overthinking anymore. Hopefully someday I'll be able to let go, but today is not that day."

" It’s why I always advice people to trust but verify especially when you start to see signs or red flags. No one likes to live with regrets or wonder what the future may hold when you can get the answer's now!!! Cheating shows a lack of morality, it is a mindset that is created and shaped from early childhood. It shows opportunistic traits. It demonstrates a lack of intrinsic moral fibre. It shows that the person thought so little about their partner that they then made a calculated decision to have sex with someone else.

"Sometimes I wonder if I will ever meet someone that actually wants me, someone that actually wants to know my life, my thoughts, why I think like I do, my insecurities, my inspirations, someone thats pantinece enough to wait for me to open up, someone that actually notices my texting pattern from what mood I am in, someone that hypes me up when I show them a picture, someone that take screen shots of me, someone that wants to do small things but cute things for me, someone that believes in me, someone that actually cares about how I am doing, someone that would send me morning messages or someone that fights to keep me in their life. Someone that plans dates with me, surprises me with things they think would be fun for both of us, someone that wants to talk for hours, someone that wanna go places with me. Someone that shows me how important I am to them, who tells me I am enough for them. 
Someone that tries to communicate with me, someone that want to work things out or take the problems together.

Someone that's not just suddenly gonna lose interest in me, 
Someone that trust me enough to let me in their life, to tell me about their interests, insecurities, their way of thoughts, someone that would be happy to see my name pop up on their screen, someone I can show how much they mean to me, how much I will support them if I could get the chance, to spend time with them, to explore, experience a lot of things, to build something real, show them I want to know their bad as well as good sides. 

It feels as if I am never really going to meet that person, as if I am just meant to be alone, to see and hear about others special someone.
I am tired of always meeting a person I think is gonna be this person and yet they just aren't
Do I really have so high expectations, am I living in a fantasy land, or does people like this really exist?"
"this is to you. your every word made me feel like im skinned alive, like im transparent. like every person that didn‘t see me is at fault. your words let me feel shame and thirst. shame about my inability to hide and thirst to be seen by you, again and again. 

i‘m never gonna read your words again and that hurts. it hurts to know that you won‘t ever again use your inquisitive eyes, your analytical mind to address me in some way. 

what is love, what is infatuation? a phantasy: to want to be addressed by someone, to be someone‘s address. 

this is to you. i felt powerless being perceived by you. like you knew everything about me there is to know about me without me even uttering a single word. 

i am obsessed with the idea of you. and you were obsessed with having me where you wanted me: formable, at your mercy, thoughtless. 

i think: is there really fate or is there only free will? 

maybe every time you looked at me you actually saw someone else. maybe you projected your issues with your someone on me. and maybe i thought: this is me, this is my true self, this. maybe you formed me and i adapted to my new form. did you actually see me or did you see yourself within me? 

i know that i felt like only i could perceive you like you wanted to be perceived. 

i don‘t trust myself and you don‘t trust

period. 

i wish. i could have been your someone. someone to you. someone. 

i will address you until i‘ve found another someone to address.

"Me (M, 22) and my ex (F, 22) have been broken up for a year but have been chatting regularly over the past couple weeks since my birthday. I suspect that she might have hidden feelings for me still that she’s scared to admit but I’m also lowkey scared to ask her out incase she rejects me. The reason why I suspect that she still has feelings for me is because I posted going out on a date with another girl for the first time on Snapchat and she instantly deleted me as soon as she viewed it. She added me back the next day but those actions have led me to believe that there’s still feelings there on both sides. Also, we spoke on the phone last week and she told me that her head is still over the place about whether she wants to get back together or stay single.

I still love my ex from the bottom of my heart and would do anything to get back with her cuz she means everything to me. There were issues from the previous relationship which I’ve reflected on and really want to right those wrongs if we were to ever try again. I’ve tried moving on by dating other girls but it just don’t feel right and there isn’t that romantic, intimate connection that I have with my ex every time I see her.

It’s been on my mind for the past 2 days but I want to ask her out to a clubbing event on the 30th July which I know she would enjoy. In the past, we’ve met up and gone out to several restaurants, cocktail bars and mini golf places as exes but for some reason, I’m more scared than ever to ask her out this time.  Should I ask her out and if so, what would be the best way to approach this ?"
""
I recently broke up with my boyfriend and i feel horrible. I messed up really bad and i keep thinking back to how i could of done things differently and what i should of done differently too. I keep randomly remembering all the things we did together and the time we spent with each other. It hurts like crazy and i always think about the past decisions i made and what i should of ended up doing but didn’t. Its eating me up inside and i miss them so much but i also just wanna forget about them. Idk what to do about it.
"I just wanna say fuck u, ghadd if i only knew. Just a reminder never date your best guy friend. Lol u givin me trust issues to pack heck."
What a pushy kind of guy. Cut me some slacks off dude.
"My ex hung out with me past weekend. He was high and drunk. He asked me if I loved him ans I told him. During our relationship never said it because I didn't want him to push me away for loving him. Anyways he told me he loved me. We said something about how I wish it worked out and it was bad timing.

 He brings up stuff from 5 years ago. I said something and that determined him from not being with me. He acted funny one day with me but apparently that was his personality. 6 weeks i was still trying to figure him out, I didn't know that was part of his personality. To be reserved. Anyways I was irritated about it and he determined that he didn't want to be with me bc of that..

Fast forward to 5 years later
Long story short. I think I need to move on bc he's dating other people now. But also hooks up with me. He is mad at me for dating when we broke up but I dated to be distracted not to find a man.. I stopped dating. 
But I really want to fix my codependency issues and want to fix things with him..."
The pain goes down only enough for it to noticeably come back up and wash over my soul.
"We've been broken up for a while now but she was my first love and hurt me worse than I ever could have imagined being hurt.

Everybody said she was fucked up, not good for a relationship, wouldn't settle down for a long time, would be going for fling to fling.  Well less than a year after we were done, she committed to the guy she slept with behind my back the first time we dated and has been with him since.  Fucking kills me she's been the loving committed girlfriend that I thought I was getting all to this guy from another country she screwed behind my back.

I had to see her because she is my best friend's fiance's sister and we had some pre wedding stuff to do as the wedding party.

I don't have that visceral anxious reaction to seeing her anymore.  We, as a group, had a good time.  My ex and I even talked 1 on 1 for a bit.  Didn't hurt or kill me.  Till she told me she's moving to the Mediterranean with him.  Didn't kill me but just such a wtf.

It's just sucks and is so weird, somebody that used to cuddle as close to me as she could, squeeze me and tell me she loves me, tell me how happy I made her, would giggle with me nonstop, tell me everything about her life and her days, now looked at me as if I'm somebody she's met maybe 10 times in her life.  I was the one she used to get so excited and happy to see.  I was the one she was thinking about all the time.  The one in her heart.  Now she sees me and I'm pretty sure I'd measure up to be less than a speck of dust in her universe.

I didn't expect her to jump into my arms or anything like that, it's just weird.  And it still hurts deep down that she couldn't be committed to me and love me the way she does this guy she's been with.

All I wanted was her to love me the way she said and acted like she did.  To be really committed to me.  It's sad to think about all the places we could have traveled, live music we would have seen, the group dates we could have gone on, the breakfasts, the lunches, the dinners, all the small special moments.  Never happened.

I guess she'll always be the one that got away.

Fuck."

The thing about Real love? Is that it can never hurt. Only our bad experiences…our worst trials. Make love sometimes appear the worst. Love was never meant to be a game. Never supposed to make us cry. But when one abuses our love and betrays us? Our hearts want to give up the fight. When love is abused…and trust is broken like a seal. It is the pain that blinds us. And make us wonder if true love is even real. When our love for the one in the past was only left to wither….it is the rejection we feel that makes us cold and bitter. But the one that chooses to look past the heart in the very face of pain? Is indeed the one who knows love is true. And this truth is how we begin again.😊💕💕Don’t ever think that love is the reason for your pain. Love will never hurt us. It was never meant to be a game. 



As a female…I know sometimes it feels that every man will hurt you. And no man will treasure your heart. But I believe that not all men are the same .😊💕 Men have been hurt by women too. Not all women will break your heart. A soul that will cherish your heart no matter what. This is the love I wish for. And you wish for it too.🥰"

"Hi everyone! I ended my on&amp;of relationship of 3 years about 2 months ago. My ex currently has a girlfriend and seems to be happily in love and love-bombing her.
I, on the other hand still struggle each morning not waking next to him, or trying to block the thousand thoughts that come to be about him.

I am also in therapy, doing personal activities, hobbies, studying but if I’m being honest sometimes it just doesn’t make the cut.

Idk if im missing physical touch or the attention of someone that wants me. 

I just want to know what are some of the tools that can help me open up more to new possibilities, to people and to move on!

Any recommendation or advice is greatly appreciated!❤️"
It's been 4-6 years since I've talked to her but I still miss her very day and there's almost never a day I don't think about her I just miss her so much but I've learn to live with it I guess.
"I don't have anyone to talk to but I really want to talk about why I'm sad.

About a year and a half ago I was leaving work and saw the prettiest girl I've ever seen. I fell in love immediately. From that point on I did everything I could to see her more like a fucking creeper but I could never talk to her because it would feel like I couldn't breathe when I saw her. It took me about 6 months to finally have a conversation with her but it was worth it. We talked for a long time and despite still feeling so nervous around her, I felt so comfortable with her and felt like we could talk about anything forever. It really just felt right.

Every day at work we would always be together, after about 2 months I finally asked for her number and we would always text and message each other. Her friends all noticed how much time we spent together and they all told me they thought she was in love with me. So, one day I asked her out to lunch and planned to tell her how I felt about her. I felt like I was jumping off a cliff but I told her everything. About how I immediately fell in love with her, how long it took me to talk to her, how pretty I thought she was and how I still felt the same for her. She just kept giggling and asked why it took so long. She left to go back to work after that.

We talked later and she told me she wasn't ready for a relationship. She said she needed to rebuild her confidence because her last bf treated her like shit. We would still talk and flirt a lot but after that lunch I knew she didn't feel about me the same way I felt about her and she just didn't want a relationship with me but I kept hoping. I guess she would play along too. One time she told me that if I liked her and wanted to be with her then I would tell her what I got her for Christmas.

Fast forward another month or two of the same shit and out of nowhere one of her friends and one of my friends both told me that she started dating a guy in a different state. I was devastated and asked her about it, she just kept trying to avoid the question and wouldn't give me a straight answer.

So I stopped talking to her and did everything in my power to never see her again. I thought I was over her because I finally started talking to a few other girls that were interested in me, but today I finally saw her and and still felt exactly the same was as I did when I first saw her. I'm still in love with her. Fuck."
"I had the worst love story I think, I came with my second ex for a fourth time. We have been together four different times since 2015, this one really hurt me because I feel guilty, or she made me feel guilty. I was too jealous, I didn’t trust her, she have done shit in the past, she cheated on her ex with me. But I feel guilty because I was with she again and I feel like I ruined everything. At the end I was right, she was texting another dude and now I supposed she is dating him. 

I feel guilty because she told me the day we broke up that I was the one who ruined the relationship and that everything was my fault. I started crying because the fucking shit broken everything inside of me and she just keeps living her life just as whenever we are not together.

I think this is one of the most toxic relations stories that I have heard and it is my own story. I’m broken inside still and it is over a month since the last time we talked. I swear to my mom that I would never ever talked to this horrible person again. It’s been almost 7 years suffering for the same person. It is not fair.

Sorry for my bad English, I’m from South America."
For a whole year I dated someone who claimed that he wasn’t ready for a relationship. He said it was too soon after his breakup from a long term relationship. We ended about two months ago and now he has a gf and they live together. That’s enough to really fuck me up good. Even though I’ve also moved on it hurts. Like I wasn’t good enough
"Hey guys... sorry for the long text.

I've been getting close to this girl at my office. She's around my age and we started to get along really well. She was just a friend and i wasn't even attracted to her. All was going well until... i started to develop some heavy feelings. I guess i'm screwed and it hurts like crazy. I'm pretty sure she doesn't reciprocate. Still i don't want to end this friendship, that'd be like running away. But guys... it hurts... it hurts soooo much. Even hearing her talking about her ex is like someone's gouging out my heart... it hurts.

I just wanted to vent a bit and felt like here there might be people who can understand how i'm feeling right now."
My question is... Is it wrong to use your ex picture as motivation to overcome the pain and go harder in your life?
"I'm on day 3 of this break up, I started to feel better last night but this morning I haven't stopped crying 
I think a part of me thought he would have come back, said he misses me and wants to get back together. But he hasn't, and it hurts so fucking much. I can't deal with this, I feel like screaming and tearing my hair out. I want him back so badly. How can I function without him??? I have no one"
"A couple months back I had a thing with this one girl who I met at a house party I was at with my then best friend. Cut to a month later and I think things are going well, I was the best version of myself (payed for all the dates, gave her some of my really cool shirts and was always a gentleman to her) One night I find out that my ""best friend"" was at hers from another friend and neither her or my ""best friend"" told me. I got really skeptical and I was in a bad headspace because I had just got some really bad news, still I gave them the benefit of the doubt. The next day I find out from another friend that they indeed fucked and I completely lost it. My whole world turned upside down and I felt used, betrayad and completely worthless and disrespectes. A few days later I asked her why the fuck she did that and she said ""I don't owe you and explanation"" which really fucked me up emotionally, because treated her like a queen and ended up getting completely and utterly heartbroken. I don't talk to either of them anymore and am in the process of healing and finding myself. 

I gave her the world and she broke my heart, however she did give me 2 things
1)trust issues
2)a lesson in which no matter how good of a guy you are, some girls just aren't worth the effort. If the streets is where they belong then the streets is where they'll reside. It's not your fault if they fuck you over, but it's your responsibility in how you react and how you take it.

To all my king's out there with shattered hearts, I just want you to know that it's not the end of the world, you have to find yourself and know your worth, don't engage in an argument or a fight that's beneath you. Most importantly NEVER FIGHT OVER A GIRL. Because if you aren't her first choice then you certainly will always feel inadequate. Learn to walk away from things that aren't good for you. Move on with life and don't stress about hoes, instead treat yourself and your family like royalty as opposed to girls who don't know how to appreciate things.

Remember all the money in the world can't buy loyalty, respect and your love and attention, trust and affection.
Keep that shit for yourself until a girl has ""earned it"" as the weekend once said.

I hope this helps whoever reads it"
"So there’s this girl that I’ve liked for months, after speaking for a while I got the courage to ask her on a date and she accepted. It was a bit awkward as expected but overall I felt like it went really well, we had a laugh and got on great. However after the date she’s started airing my messages so I assume there’s no hope in this going anywhere and I feel so lost. How can I get over this? I really appreciate anyone who takes time out of their to help me."
"I swear when I get over you, I am never going to let a female make me feel this way again."
"Happy Wednesday my friends! I hope you all have a wonderful and productive day! Please send me any prayer requests if you all need anything! Cheer up someone having a bad day and a blessing in people’s lives, just a call/text can change someone’s day!

“The Lord hath done great things for us; whereof we are glad. Turn again our captivity, O Lord, as the streams in the south. They that sow in tears shall reap in joy. He that goeth forth and weepeth, bearing precious seed, shall doubtless come again with rejoicing, bringing his sheaves with him.”

"She said she couldn’t do it with me because she couldn’t “commit to something serious” 
Yet she’s falling in love with him
Respecting him
Taking him seriously.
It’s not that you can’t commit, you just didn’t want to do it with me. 
Just be honest when asked."
... Inscribed to the sad and lonely.
"How do you cope with the fact that someone you were so in love with and cared for never really gave a shit about you?? I believed everything he told me about how special I was, and how he’s “never felt this way before” but now his actions prove he doesn’t care about me in the slightest. I’m trying to not take it personally but I don’t know what I did to make him care so little about me now. He’s discarded me like it’s nothing…and now I’m left looking in the mirror alone thinking “how could he treat me like this, what is wrong with me” 😓 I saw the way he looked at me, the way he held me, the things he said. Could they all have been lies? I just don’t understand"
"My best friend and husband told me he no longer was in love with me at the end of June after 16 years.

This was after a week of unusual anxiousness on his part. It mainly started after he mentioned that he wanted me to meet/hang out with a coworker and her fiancé that I had never heard of. With covid, I was very isolated and deep in depression and grief. I wasn’t even seeing people that I wanted, so it was hard for me to want to see people that I didn’t even know. With the help of a therapist, I started to make some progress, but again, I just wasn’t ready to meet new people quite yet.

I didn’t know it at the time, but he really wanted to just hang out with her. He kept bringing it up. Something felt off. I asked if I was just a pawn, so he could feel better about wanting to hang out with her by himself.

I feel like I’ve handed him over to this person on a silver platter. Or her maybe. He’s in pain and she is there to console him. They’re hanging out 24/7 almost, they text all days, they’ve started saying I love you, they call each other best friend. He bought her gifts shortly before our anniversary.

In a blink of an eye, I’m just no one. My “soulmate” (he was the one to have said that) is gone. I’m being torn in half. After 16 years, I’m just no one. I feel like I’m just suspended in space floating aimlessly. Not sure who or what I am. Just alone."
"How do you shake off the feeling of wanting them to come back. How do you 'not miss them'. I really wanna forget about him, but I just can't. He was all I had and now he's gone, I seriously don't have anything left. Any tips on how to move on from a breakup?"
"I've already posted my breakup story a few days ago in another thread. I should be relieved that is over, but I'm hurting like hell.  I could really use someone to talk too. 

[https://www.reddit.com/r/BreakUps\_Help/comments/om8shj/my\_boyfriend\_32m\_of\_6\_years\_just\_broke\_up\_with\_me/](https://www.reddit.com/r/BreakUps_Help/comments/om8shj/my_boyfriend_32m_of_6_years_just_broke_up_with_me/)"
"When I was 20 I got my first boyfriend. This was my first time using birth control and having sex regularly. Unfortunately I was irresponsible and became pregnant. As soon as I told my boyfriend he said he wanted me to keep the baby. He didn't pressure me either way but he never took back that he wanted to keep the baby and would be present in the baby's life. I still ended up making the decision to have an abortion because I was in college and not financially independent from my parents. It was the hardest decision I ever had to make and the fact that my boyfriend was supportive of keeping it made it even harder to decide. Post abortion, I found out from another girl that boyfriend was cheating on me the entire time. I don't understand how he could tell me to keep it knowing what he was doing behind my back. It hurt to find out that I was really on my own during that hard time in which I thought he was the only person who understood what I was going through. This happened over a year ago and fortunately we are broken up. But I will never get over this heartbreak. It traumatized me and changed me for the rest of my life."
"one of my only and best friends just traded pics with my ex

it only jsut fucking gets worse man so much for trust"
"but I know you don’t care and it’s no use so I’m saying it all here. 

good for you for getting everything you always wanted the entire time we spent together. I’m glad you got back with the girl who’s always had your heart. I hope it means that you’ll never do what you did to me to anyone else. because you completely destroyed me and I keep slipping farther and farther into the worst depression of my life. as I sit here I know that you will never know exactly how much you’ve hurt me. I know you’re sitting there on the beach with her feeling pretty much innocent. you’re not sorry about what happened. because you got what you wanted. I’m the only one that’s hurting now and that doesn’t matter to you. I’m not sure if I will ever move on from us. there’s always going to be something that draws me to you. you were the only one and you always will be"

"Don’t get me wrong, this stage is much better than being crushed all the time and wanting him back at some point, but I’m honestly just tired of thinking about him. He doesn’t deserve any ounce of my energy. He started dating a new girl two months after he broke up with me because he “wanted to be single.” During our three plus year relationship he threw stuff at me when he got mad, coerced me into having sex with him several times, made me comfort him after he knew he had assaulted me, separated me from my family and friends, and made me feel stupid for liking anything that I liked. I just took it all in stride the whole time. I told myself I was happy because this was the person I was going to be with so I better be happy. Well now I have processed all the things he did to me and I think he is a vile person, but that anger is just consuming me that this point. Any tips?"
"Just got broken up with by the first guy that I met on hinge last summer who became my boyfriend around the holidays proceeding. 

Most notable is that he was the first guy I’d met who I’d disclosed my HSV positive diagnosis to. Of course I was ashamed to tell him because of the societal stigma around it but he was so gracious &amp; assured me that if it came time for anything like that, we would be careful &amp; that I didn’t have to be ashamed. We were already on &amp; off in the beginning, he seemed interested but already seemed to be an avoidant attachment type, whereas I’m an anxious attachment type. I still decided to go all in because he was the only person that I seemed to have a connection with out of all the others I dated. My insecurities got the best of me &amp; I made an awful mistake and looked through his phone, which made him kick me out of his house. We stopped talking for a couple days but I sent him an olive branch in the guise of two things that I knew he enjoyed/liked &amp; we started talking again some days after that.

Fast forward to now, he broke up with me this weekend for the second time this month because he doesn’t think he can make me happy. I feel stupid for wanting to continue this cat &amp; mouse (me being the cat) because it’s somewhat true - he currently doesn’t have my sexual appetite, he doesn’t enjoy being with my friends, we don’t have the same hobbies, he likes being alone &amp; playing video games &amp; I like being around him &amp; going out. We’re both relatively good people who are incompatible, I understand. But we have both come to love each other. He doesn’t want me to waste my time with him but I don’t think it’s a waste at all. I’m conflicted &amp; sad, but am hoping &amp; praying that he changes his mind. 

Modesty aside, I’m a catch &amp; am not concerned about being alone or not finding someone else. I want to be with him &amp; be there for him, as foolish as it sounds."

"why do i still have love for someone who doesn’t even want to talk to me? Is my heart too kind, am I obsessed, was she the one, am i delusional. I don’t know what the fuck to think. I try to tell myself you don’t need to love her no more but it’s easier said than done."
"I know what to say, just don’t know how to say it"
"I literally felt it in my chest when he said he didn’t think we would work out. I didn’t know it was such a physical feeling. He’s said he won’t break up with me unless things (his mental health) get worse. I feel like i’m being led on to believe it’s going to be okay but he’s really just buying time to be with me. We are each other’s first loves of just under two years. I don’t know what i’d do without him, he is my entire life. Everything is falling apart. he’s never expressed anything other than love for me before and it’s come out of the blue."
"I met this woman while traveling, in a really emotionally vulnerable state. I literally bumped into her in a shop and we smiled. Then bumped into her again 5 mins later on the street. We spent the next 48 hours together. It was like a movie. this was 6 months ago, we've been together ever since. I'm a very strange/weird person and so is she and she instantly understood me. this has NEVER happened. NEVER. everything that I hold most precious, she does too. it's magic to see the world with her by my side.I'm 35, have had countless girlfriends, even a fiancé, and I never knew how alone I'd been my entire life. no one ever made me feel the way she did - so seen, so understood. the first time we hugged gave me more feeling - gave me shooting stars in my eyes - than the entire 2 year relationship with my ex.

after that first 48 hours together we parted briefly before reuniting, I sat down and sobbed with joy for hours. I've never done that before. it was utterly unreal. a dream.

she just asked me for space today. she says we can't talk for a while because she's going through depression. I'm horrified that we never will again and she's trying to let me down gently. the thought of these coming days of not knowing, of being so far from her heart, hurts so so so much. I've never been in so much pain. I am in so much pain because I feel all of her pain and want to be there for her and she won't let me and I know I need to respect that.

but then on top of that, I just miss her so damn much. I miss her hair. I miss the way she liked to stare into my eyes and how when she was sad or in a bad mood I could make her melt, I could get a reluctant smile that would turn into beautiful laughter that makes my heart shiver. I miss the way her neck smells when I curl up against her in bed and bury my face in her nape. I miss holding her hand walking down the street because she wasn't just holding my hand, she was reaching inside my soul and holding my soul. I've never been so incredibly proud to be with someone, like an angel was put on earth just for me. then I think of some other man coming in and being with her instead of me and I swear to god I'd rather be physically tortured than think of that. I searched 35 years for her and I can't imagine ever finding this ever again."

But something in my mind told me that this shit ain't worth it I won't text her. Don't fall in the trap bro stay dangerous.
"In the end he pretended like nothing happened between us. That is was all just in my head and I don't know why he did that. I guess I'll never know. I still love him and that's ok. Nobody is going to tell me what to do and I will love him even if he for some reason didn't want me to. I am loving him from a distance and I hope to meet someone else who I can love again. 

I don't want him anymore. He hurt me too much and I don't think I will ever be able to forget that amount of pain."
"It's going to be 3 months in 3 days that we've been broken up and no contact. Just need to get this off my chest

Everything was happy with my ex (dumper) during the 10years, even though we see each other once a week and some weeks 2x. I know it isn't much but during those years I had to look after my grandparents (dementia, one after the other), going to school, going to work etcetc, you know be an adult and earn money. 

When the pandemic hit and studying for 3 exam my mental health went down hill. The pandemic pretty much forced me to slow down in life and my mind was able to wander/think. My ex never seen me so down before (word for word), he did the minimal comfort but something in me wanted more but I didn't know what it was. Prior to the breakup he wanted to move our relationship to the next stage in life - marriage. When he mentioned it, my anxiety/panic shot up like a missle. I was scared, I couldn't entirely pinpoint why I'm scared but I think it was because of my mother (brief: mom doesn't like my ex, dated behind her back, had childhood trauma - emotional neglect, raised to be independent, can not be vulnerable to anyone, people pleaser etcetc).

Prior to the break up, I told him I was in the process of seeing a therapist to see what is wrong with my mind, why I'm scared. I do see a future with him, living in a house with white picket fence with our child running around in the backyard. To be honest, at the beginning of the relationship I never had that fear..probably I subconciously changed during those years being together. After trying my best to explain and articulate my feelings - in his head, he probably thinks I've been stringing him along all those years and treated him as a second options. Which isn't true at all, I poured my heart, soul, body in this relationship. He said because I was scared of my mom and unable to stand by his side, he will find someone new. He wanted me to say something for him to stay in the relationship, but I respect myself to not beg and give empty promises...so I let him go. A little bit after a month he found someone new and made it official in all social media platform (I have him muted). Not sure if it's a rebound because he said he didn't even think of breaking up with me a week before. (Taking all the info from the BU with a grain of salt)

I was never able to be vunerable, but with him I slowly let down my walls. It was the final wall that was left, which I think my therapist and I both agree - emotional support &amp; feeling safe/secure, which I lacked in childhood. I guess he was never the type to see the details and voice them out when it's about me. Especially during the pandemic/stress, I lost 15lbs and he only noticed/mentioned it when someone said something infront of him. 

So reddit, beside the commitment problem I have...was it entirely my fault that caused this breakup? I still love him even though he said some mean things during the break up but it's all true, can probably say I'm spinless. I made a choice to let him go so he could find happiness at the cost of my own and didn't want him to put his life on hold for me. I know, I shouldn't be hopeful but I still would like to work things out with him..even though he's with someone new.."
"After facing rejection after rejection from you, I’ve come to understand that you don’t want anything to do with me.

I got it. I understand now.

I’ll stop asking you to hang out with me or do things with me.

I’ll stop asking you for help.

I’ll stop bothering you with my feelings and worries.

I understand. I’m just a nuisance to you so I’ll stop. I’ll go. I’m just in the way.

You hate me. You don’t like who I am as a person. You wish I was someone else.

I’m just a bother. I get it.

I’m sorry for bothering you. I wanted your attention too badly. I became a burden to you.

So I’ll just go. Slip away quietly and disappear.

I don’t want to hurt anymore. I don’t want to keep banging on your door only for you to never answer.

I got it. I got the hints. I’ll leave you alone.

I’m not wanted here."
"So yesterday I saw my ex on a mutual friend's (her roommate) snap story. They were at this pub near their apartment. The story showed my ex, and a guy next to her that I recognized as one of her exes.

I had lived with her and the roommate for about a year when she broke up with me. I was due to move into my new apartment three weeks after, so between crashing on my friend's couch, I had to come back every now and then to pack up my stuff for the big move out day. Two weeks after she broke up with me, I come back and find her and one of her exes that she cheated on me with sitting on our couch. It hurt, but I was there to do a job and I was polite and cordial. Left after I was done. Then, I come back a couple days later, and another ex of hers was sitting on the couch, and that ex is the one on the snap story. They slept in the same bed that I used to share with her (although her roommate says they didn't do anything together). 

All that to say, my ex is a trashy person with trashy behavior, and this ex of hers that's suddenly come around in her life conveniently when I'm gone is the same kind of person -- no motivation, lazy, still working at his high school fast food job (all this stuff is stuff I've witnessed and heard from our roommate and other friends of my ex).

At first it hurt to see them together, since she only broke up with me two months ago, but then I genuinely laughed. The sheer downgrade she's taken is a perfect example of what she lost when she dumped me.

So I went and hit the gym after seeing that and ran 3.5 miles for the first time in two years.

Sorry for the rant, I just needed to get my thoughts out there!"
"Me (26M) and my ex (23F) were so much more than lovers. We were as one, a unbeatable team. Everything we did, we did together, we were spontaneous, we were happy, we traveled the world together. we stayed in for days together.
We planned our whole lives together for the future, we knew exactly where we were gonna live, how many kids we wanted, we had a couple of names picked out for them, depending on what they were gonna look like. We were both so insanely sure we were each other’s soul mate. 

As long as we had each other, we had everything.

We both get tired of people easily, meaning that, obviously we hung out with our mutual friends, and our own friends, we hung out with our families and others in general, but when the social quota was met, we both felt the need to be alone.
Especially me, I really enjoyed being alone, just have no one else around me. 
But with her, alone came second. I got that same relaxed feeling I got from being alone, with her, but it was better. 

Obviously we fought, we argued and we growled. But we ALWAYS made up, say it was just one of us going out for a cigarette on the balcony and coming back in, or just simply talking it out, we always made up. We were never on bad terms when we went to bed. None of us ever slept on the couch for a night.
We’ve broken up a couple of times, but we always found ourselves back together, we were even friends with benefits most of the time when we weren’t a couple. 

We are complete opposites as people, she has a handful of diagnoses, most notably ADHD, Aspergers and OCD. So she gets anxious easily. When she was a roller coaster of a mess in her emotions, I was always there taking care of her, being her rock. It didn’t matter how many sleepless nights or how many days I had to cancel everything because of her, because nothing else mattered more to me than her well being.
Everything else came in second.

So with her fluctuating mood swings, she needed a very predictable and planned day ahead.
She is extremely verbatim, if I said “dinners in 15 minutes” or “we leave in 10” and something came up or thing took a little longer than planned, she would absolutely loose it.
It was hard at first, but I got used to it and soon it wasn’t a problem to be more precise in my choice of wording.

We broke up because I fucked up big time. I didn’t cheat or do anything to her, physically or mentally.  I would never hurt her in any way or form. 
But I fucked up, I made the biggest mistake of my life 6 months ago and we’ve been broken up since. 

But we’re still best friends. We’re still each other’s “person” 

No one knows me like she knows me and no one knows her like I know her. We have been through everything from suicidal thoughts to pure ecstasy together. She’s the only person in this world who has seen me weak and has seen me cry. 

We still see each other pretty much daily. We still laugh and do sports together, we still eat and talk about the dumbest shit together.




But now she has found someone she’s seeing. 
And it is absolutely crushing me. 

It feels like I’m under water and that someone’s standing on my chest as I try to scream. 

I can’t cry because I’m not able to cry alone or with anyone else but her. 

I’ve met him, and he seems like a really nice guy, he’s good looking and has a stable job. 

I am really happy for her. I truly am. I care more about her than I do for myself.
But for myself I’m devastated. I’ve never felt more alone in my entire life. 

It sounds so cliche but it really feels like a huge chunk of me is missing.

Every morning I wake up because of severe panic attacks, with pulse going through the roof and the feeling of not being able to breathe.
But then I usually see her, and everything is ok again.
She comes outside my place and we meet up to go for a walk or work out usually. 
But then at the end of the day, as I drop her off or the guy who she’s seeing comes to pick her up, it’s back to square one again. 

It kills me that she’s going to look up at him with the same squinting eyes and laugh she looked at me with.

It kills me that it’s his chest she’s going to fall asleep on.

It kills me that it’s him shes gonna cuddle up next to when she wakes up in the middle of the night. 

It kills me that it’s his hoodies she’s gonna be stealing.

It kills me that it’s him who’s going the be hugged from behind as he cooks for her.

But she’s happy. And for me that’s all that matters, really. It just sucks that I’m not the one who’s the source of her happiness anymore.

If you did, thank you for reading, I just needed to vent I think."
"52 days of not hearing a word from her. She chose to leave this way because she “had to.” It was the only way, so she went complete radio silence and blocked me on every forum possible.  It didn’t stop me from sending messages and emails though. A lot of them. A LOT… the final numbers were actually not as bad as I thought, but still pretty bad. Averaged out to over 3.3 emails per day.  Before you scold me for that, save it. I already know how dumb it was and how much dignity I lost.

Yesterday when I heard back, I got a peace sign and some condescending words. Keep in mind, I did nothing wrong. Didn’t cheat, didn’t get caught in some big lie, didn’t flirt or fight with a friend or family member… nothing.

After two very brief and rude messages I ask her how she has managed to turn me into her enemy all of the sudden. She says I tried to ruin her job and get her in trouble by sending in appropriate emails with naked pics in them. ???

I went back over my emails with a fine tooth comb, and couldn’t find a single inappropriate email sent to her work. Not one. 

She did something like this before, although before she claimed she couldn’t talk to me because she was getting sober. This also turned out to be a complete lie, as I found out she went out drinking  the weekend before AND the weekend after she sent that to me.

In the end it doesn’t matter; for some weird, nonsensical reason she now views me as her enemy. Not as her ex? Or a got she dated whom she no longer has feelings for, but an enemy. I’m not sure how to process this. 

I’ve always maintained a friendship with all my exes (all except for one), and that goes all the way back to Jr High. So this level of instant change and perspective shift is foreign to me. And this lover to foe situation is definitely new to me.

Not only that, but if I am being honest… it absolutely broke me. I feel utterly f%#¥ing shattered right now. I thought I was ready for anything. I thought there is nothing she could say when I heard from her that I wouldn’t be able to accept and move on with…

Wow was I wrong. Not only does she not love me, not only does she have no desire to see or hear from me ever again, and not only does she harbor resentment against me despite me not doing anything wrong, but now she also sees me as an enemy who has literally tried to hurt her on purpose. I wasn’t ready for that. I wasn’t ready at all.

I feel myself sinking into this chair…. which I can feel descending into the abyss below the ground. Slowly. Like the sun disappearing on the horizon just after magic hour.

The light is faint, but at least I will get some rest in this darkness. When I return to the surface, maybe I will be more callous. Stronger and more ready for the pain of this life.  No. I am certain I will be. I have no choice."
"My fiance left me 6 months ago and it was all my fault. He wasn't showing me any attention no more and I have a long history of depression. I turned to alcohol and party drugs (mainly cocaine). Every chance I got, I partied and he went fishing or camping.  I suggested a break, just to give us space away from eachother,  we were young when we met (me 19 and him 22) and we had spent 6 long years together. 

But it seems he prefers his peace away from me and has decided to lock me off and be very cruel with me. He wants no contact and from what I've heard from him he has nothing bit hatred towards me.

But its like he's ignoring all the good times, we travelled the world together and I don't see how he can just let that go.

Since the breakup I've done everything to numb the pain. Drink, drugs, sex with other men. Obviously not working 🙄 

Sometimes I'm just hit with a sharp pain when anything reminds me of him. 

I just want to die :( I wish I could wipe any memory of him and move on with my life."

I’m just completely devastated. But after everything that has happened there’s no going back so I know that I need to move forward like I normally do.

"It’s been 6 months. I still think about you and cry over you and love you just as much  as the day you left. At this point I’m wondering - do I even want to get over you? The thought of no longer thinking about you every night or finding someone new is in some ways exciting but in other ways repulsive to me. If I stop being heart broken over you, it’ll mean our story is officially over. Being heart broken over you is my only way to still be connected to you. A part of me doesn’t want to stop thinking about you, because that’ll mean our story is officially over."
"Well, found out today she's dating the guy she told me not to worry about.

Dated for 2.5 years, moved in together in August and she was out by January. 

Starting in October she started going to hang out with a male friend I had never met. I didn't think too much about it until she came home with an expensive gift from him.

I questioned her about the gift and why I hadn't met him, to which she became extremely defensive,  claimed I didn't trust her and broke up with me a week later,  saying she ""couldn't come back from being accused of cheating. ""

I feel so pathetic."
"I tried to get in a Discord call with one of my friends in an SMP. And he said no. And I asked why. And he said, AND I QUOTE, ""I don't talk to strangers."""
