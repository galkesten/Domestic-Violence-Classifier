"I‚Äôve decided that I cannot go back home. I‚Äôve made a plan to apply to part-time low qualification jobs so that I have some kind of income right away while I wait for interviews for the full-time jobs that I‚Äôve applied to.

The next problem I have to deal with is that I‚Äôm running out of my medication. I need to find a new psychiatrist first, since I can‚Äôt be treated by my university psychiatrist anymore, because I‚Äôm no longer a student, because I just graduated. I‚Äôve been using a website that my university psychiatrist recommended to me to find a new doctor. I now have a list of doctors that I‚Äôd like to contact to see who is the best fit for me.

What‚Äôs the process involved in contacting a doctor that ends up in me being qualified to pay for my mental health care on a sliding scale?"
"I met this person a little over 2m ago. Everything seemed so great until one night he unleashed his frustrations on me and hit me with a magazine in my nose. At first I swore I‚Äôd never speak to him again, and eventually a week after I started speaking to him. I realized he started blaming me for every little argument or disagreement we had, he always called me crazy, and I started to believe it. I found out I was pregnant and he‚Äôd call me a murderer for wanting to abort the pregnancy because I feel as if I‚Äôm too young and I feel like he‚Äôs too mentally unstable. I had moments in the past few weeks where I‚Äôd try to contact him thinking it really was my fault and that if I was quieter things would be better but no matter what I was always a problem. So fast forward to today, and I decided to file a police report about the incident of him hitting me with a magazine. Apparently he will be prosecuted or I‚Äôm not sure how it works out and I just feel terrible but should I really?"

"Yesterday an amended criminal complaint was sent up by detectives on my (21F) case against my ex-boyfriend (22M). They filed 3 felony charges and 32 A and B misdemeanors, ranging from intended bodily harm to stalking to threatening computer messages. 

I‚Äôm feeling a whole range of emotions right now‚Äî proud of myself for putting myself and the past 5 years of my life out there, but also pretty sad?? at the fact that I might be ‚Äúruining his life.‚Äù 

I want him to be able to get his shit together and not hurt the next woman he is in a relationship with, but I also want him to finally face some consequences. 

I can just picture him being sad and it‚Äôs eating me up, I feel like I‚Äôm just on a rollercoaster with this court case. 

Does anyone else have experience with a large case like this? The cops called it ‚Äúunprecedented.‚Äù"

 My girlfriend spat on my face during an argument a week ago and after that day I have been getting weird feelings about how this relationship is going to go ahead. I don't know if this is something common and happens in relationships but I feel like my self respect has been taken away. I fear this will repeat again . Should I break up with her?
"This whole post is a trigger warning, my relationship has been slowly getting more physically violent. I have no one. I live with my boyfriend and have no family. I was kicked out two months into turning 18, and the only person I have had ever since was my boyfriend. It has slowly started to get more physically abusive. I feel very alone and stuck. I am writing this right now because we just had our worst night yet. My favorite sweater got stretched by all the pulling and forcing. I am sorry if this is a lot to unload onto strangers, I just really needed to put this out there. The only other place I get to ""talk"" about this is inside my journal. I feel so sad and stuck and alone. I really love him but he is showing his true colors. I tell myself it isn't him it just built up anger. But I am so stuck."
"Long story short I've (M,30) been seeing my gf (F, 30) for a few months and her ex who has been domestically abusive towards her has reared his head and is causing problems for us. 

He's been telling my gf to break up with me and trying to control her and saying that he's going to message me directly threatening me, but I've already blocked his number.and she had as well until he used a different number. He just can't seem to move on. 

What are our options? Any advice? Will he eventually leave us alone? We're based in the UK if that helps."
"I need to go to another court date. 
His lawyer pushed the date. 
He‚Äôs not guilty.

Why is he pleading not guilty? 
This makes me angry and upset! 
And the court does not want to push the charges.

I dont wanna see him, I dont wanna go üòû 

I want this to be over and done with, I wanna move on in my life."
"Hi,

I've got no experience with domestic violence and don't know who else to ask about it.

I have a friend who I know was abused by her ex husband and who escaped him, leaving basically all her life, ie family, friends behind. We don't know each other for that long, but ever since she told me her story I felt quite bad for her. She recently got a new boyfriend and when she introduced me I was somewhat surprised as he struck me as exactly the type of guy I thought she would want to avoid. Very bossy, aggressive and talking down to her.

I don't want to jump to conclusions and maybe my impression of him was wrong, but I do feel worried for her. Part of me wants to just end all contact, as I don't feel like there's anything I can do to help her, that's why I want to ask if anyone here maybe has some helpful advice.

Thanks"

"I literally don't know how to feel or what to do or expect. Holy shit, I can't believe it's going this far. Anyone have personal experience or advice? All I have is a states attorney and he has a lawyer..."
"I heard a woman yelling for help outside my apartment. I looked outside and saw a man attacking a woman in a car. I opened my window and yelled at them to pull over (they were still sort of rolling down the street), mostly because I wanted the woman to know someone was hearing her. I called 911 but as I was on the phone they drove away.

I don't know if this was the right thing to do. I did some research afterward and am learning that getting the police involved can sometimes escalate DV situations. Was calling 911 the right response? If not, how can I respond better in the future?

For context, from what I could see it looked like both of these people were white, which I think is important if we're considering the risk of *police* violence in response to this."
"I seriously don‚Äôt understand how I‚Äôm suppose to get away from my partner. I‚Äôm so close to just accepting defeat and just live like this for the rest of my life. 

It took me 2 whole years to finally be confident enough to report my abuse. But lol he got arrested and not even an hour later he was back at the house. Not only was he not charged with anything they also dident notify me he was being released !? The abuse has become worse since I reported it. 

Just what the fuck."
"I'm 15 in the uk and they are 14 in the u.s, They are being abused verabally and physically by their parents and I dont know what to do. She called cps and they didnt help and she cant go to the police because Theyre worried their mum will kill them. They have been cutting alot the past few days and I'm getting worried"
"After the most recent assault, I was able to get out of the house safely the next day. I was granted a temporary restraining order, but I haven't been able to get him served. The sheriff's deputies have tried to serve him 9 times. Last night, the sheriff knew he was at his brother's house, but my abuser hid behind the door while his mother, father, brothers, and SIL denied his presence and tried to sneak him out the back into a waiting car.

His family knows he is physically violent. They knew about it before I married him but didn't tell me until after my abuser had already kicked me and hit the cat. They have tried to talk to him multiple times about it. However, when I filed for divorce, suddenly I became the bad guy in their eyes and they got on ""his side"".

Has anyone else gone through a similar incident, where the family is enabling the abuser? I just need to know I'm not alone."
My sister just confided in me that she was physically abused in her relationship a year ago. She went to the police closer to the incident but they didnt believe her. Is there anything she can do about it now? Is there anything I can do?
"I'm currently working through issues with my therapist, but I don't talk to her again until two weeks, so I'm kind of freaking. I know intense physical violence has happened, and my therapist tells me that I've been sexually assaulted too, which is weird because I didn't even think of that stuff really  as sexual assault at the time.

But this one memory has come back so vividly and I can't shake it. I was sitting on the floor by the bed playing a video game. He threw a pillow at my head as a joke. But he whipped it really hard that my head fell forward and I remember seeing black for a second. I remember him laughing about it because it was supposed to be funny.

Do abusers do this? Do they do thinks that really aren't classified as typical violence, or things that they do as jokes as a way to hurt you?"
"I‚Äôd stay im a mentally strong person and tend not to sit on too many things but witnessing my parents fight and my dad hurt my mother since the age of 8-9 has been the most difficult thing psychological I‚Äôve had to deal with, the last time I‚Äôve seen it was around 17 but I‚Äôm 20 now, but it still lingers to mind what effects it really had on me, tbh I‚Äôve lost respect for my mom and father when this did occur. I‚Äôve never been in a relationship but I tend to have been more clingy. At the time I felt scared for my life and usually I would be upset for 2 days until my parents started acting normal around each other. So anyone have any similar experiences?"
The question is if it really is recommendable for victims because I've seen a lot of negative feedback on the internet.
"My friend has been beaten up multiple times by a man, she‚Äôs 51 and a professional health care worker but won‚Äôt report it. Her kids are really scared but don‚Äôt want us to go over and ‚Äútalk‚Äù to the man. He‚Äôs a serial abuser and works for a gambling company in Australia. He‚Äôs been previously disgraced for gambling fraud but is still in the industry. Is there a way that doesn‚Äôt involve violence or my friend reporting him,  that we can ‚Äúencourage‚Äù him to back off and leave? I‚Äôd be really interested."
"Growing up my brother was violent and verbally abusive towards me. My parents would idly stand by and neglect to protect me.

So whenever I think about my brother or get stressed out with life, I often have very graphic dreams of my brother abusing me. My dad idly watching on. 

The night before my big interview I was practicing ALOT. I started to feel confident in myself and ready. 

As I was sleeping I started to have another violent dream. It was my third dream that weak of being beat by my brother. Out of nowhere my father stands up for me and protects me! I woke up happy. That‚Äôs literally all I have ever wanted.

It sucks but even though I‚Äôm not consciously fearful of my brother or feel I am in imminent danger, I get these dreams to process any type of stress I have. Maybe my dad stepping in was my brain telling me that I CAN handle my interview stress and I will be ok.

Does anyone else experience the same thing?"

"The link to the resource listing is broken.

"I'm currently in an physically, sexually and mentally abusive relationship with my long distance poly partner. 

Every time I tell him about seeing other men, which I'm allowed to do as it's the basis of our relationship, he gets so angry and verbally abusive towards me. 

I'm away from him right now, back home and quarantining and not seeing anybody is just so incredibly lonely. I want to see someone tonight who's an ex of mine and who gives me a lot support in many ways. But I feel like if I tell him he will just erupt at me and make me feel like nothing, tear me down And make me cry like he always does. Although since I've left he's already had sex with one other woman, and is looking for more on dating apps. 

I'm not currently in the position to leave him.

I guess I'm asking if It would be so wrong of me not to tell my abusive partner about this person coming over?

Thanks."
I‚Äôm very nervous for court. I have never been to court for anything before. Will I have to speak or am I able to have a lawyer speak for me? I am afraid I will have a panic attack being around the abuser. I am also scared to see him in court and scared he will try to hurt me while I‚Äôm there. Any advice ? Thank you.

"Has anyone experienced this? This is really confusing me.

I'm struggling to end a relationship with a history of both mental and physical abuse. I feel absolutely at my wit's end. When he's does abusive things, I've been trying to make it a habit of standing up for myself and stating that I will not tolerate that treatment (usually then separating us as best i can). He often breaks down crying. If i refuse to hear him out, he breaks down crying and saying he's just trying to talk to me and I'm so cold. If I point out that I have little patience considering what he's done, he's crying. If I'm distant because of how he's treated me or I get angry, he's sobbing.

This is making me feel like a bad person. Just standing my ground makes me feel like I've become the abuser. Have I? Does anyone have experience with this?

I'm struggling so much to keep a clear mind and see things for what they actually are."
"I feel like all I can do is post on reddit so sorry if you keep reading my posts here.

I'm just struggling a lot because it's hard for me to see the light at the end of the tunnel because I feel like it's years away from me and who knows what will happen by that time. I feel like I can almost see the light but it's so far away that it's easy to forget its there. 

I feel stupid like theres something wrong with me, like professional help cant help me, like im too far gone. I read all these posts to say to talk to a professional but I dont trust them and dont see what information they could offer that i thought about. If you can't help yourself, they can't help you. I dont have any family and friends I feel could help me other than just listening but I worry about putting a burden on them and stressing them out more when I still can't get out.

I love life i Just want to be able to live it"
"‚ÄúI‚Äôm not perfect and neither is your dad, I wish you good luck and to always take care of yourself. No need to reply back.‚Äù 

Months ago, she had a fear in her eyes I‚Äôll never forget when she told me to call the cops on my dad, who threatened all of our lives. I have not gone back since, and have been relying on the kindness of strangers and friends. This hurts a lot."
"I don't want to lose a friend but I also cannot lose my own health to her situation. I established my boundary of not wanting to talk about her husband anymore and now she claims I am limiting our friendship. Therefore, she wants to push me away and just not talk at all. I've been trying to support my best friend through her abusive marriage and it's taking a emotional and mental toll on me. She is back in the honeymoon phase with her husband and I told her that I can no longer pretend to be happy for her. The last abusive episode was very draining and included multiple friends and family rallying on her behalf to get her help. Since all is better for her now, she feel like she doesn't need help anymore and that we are all against her happiness. Is it better for me to just not be in her life or do I just wait to see what she does instead of completely moving on?"
Why do I still love him so much?!

In the beginning everything is perfect. Even too perfect. You think your so lucky. They even tell you you are perfect and lucky. Then it changes. And they tell you its your fault. They never said or did these things until you. Could that be true? Can i be the reason the partner manipulated hit lied cheated and conned? Or do they set it up that way? They cant keep up the charade and know by that point i am in too deep to see it clearly?
"When we were children, my little half brother (1 year younger) kept hitting me and pulling my hair. I used to go to class with bruises. My mother never did anything to stop it. I was also abused by my step father. 

Today, my mother and I had a heated argument about my trauma. She told me that since my brother was young then, I should just forget and forgive his abuse. My mother also urged me to forgive my step father. She reasoned that it was years ago, and that my brother and step father aren't abusing me now. 

I hate how she dismisses my trauma. Even if my brother was a child then, it shouldn't be my burden to forgive him. And even if it was in the past, doesnt make it any less wrong."
"I met a girl on discord who lives with her mother, and she and her brother suffer of domestic violence from their mother.

She's 18 and from the USA, and she has tried calling the CBI and she said they didn't do anything. She wants to get out of her house, and she has her best friend but she doesn't want to get them involved. We don't think the police would do anything because she's legally an adult.

We thought about opening a case in court but we're afraid it might just make the situation at home worse. She's thinking of going to a church ask for support, but yet we're still looking for better options, if possible.

Any help?

PS: Her boyfriend should be gradtuating this year and they plan to move out once that happens, but it's still some months and she has been gone through enough already."
"

I was so very young,

No one would believe what he had done.

Scratched my skin till it bled,¬†

With fingertips made of lead.¬†

Everyone believed his sweet lies,

Denying the wolf in disguise.

Asked the good doctor for help,

They ignored me for someone else.

The cops said don't bother me,

He'll just get a slap on the wrist,

And get off scott-free¬†

Your case is just one in a million,

Practically one in a zillion.

Stop crying and move on with your life,

Though those nightmares cut like a knife.

Even though the pain won't go away,

It's really all just shades of grey."
My dad can get really angry sometimes and he really hurts my brother and me an example of this is picking my brother up by his head and dropping him on the ground and he once tried throwing a stapler at me and has done the same thing to me is this domestic violence?
"One day, I will be able to support myself and my family without having to be with an abusive partner. 

One day, I can wake up and not worry about setting off the ticking time bomb that I am forced to share a house with. 

One day, I will be able to sit quietly reading a book in my living room without being feeling suffocated by another person‚Äôs anger in the room. 

One day, I will be happy, and free, and love life again. 

One day, it‚Äôll all be okay. One day."
"My stbx husband is in the military (North Carolina). I was subjected to extreme emotional, physical and sexual abuse (rape). He used to put me in a headlock and strangle me. I called the military police a few times, and was threatened with arrest. I developed severe ptsd and i think maladaptive daydreaming disorder as well. His family took his side. Throughout the whole 3 years I was hospitalized once for suicidal thoughts. I was given heavy antipsychotics and my then husband told them I was imagining things. I'm sorry if this is all over the place but has anyone ever had a mental illness and had that used against them in DV cases? Thanks."
I have heard that pimps are picking a lot of their victims from domestic violence shelters because they are easier to ‚Äúbreak in‚Äù I hope people are on the alert for this if it‚Äôs true.
"Is anyone else freaked out by homeless or womens shelters? The thought of having to go to one gives me so much anxiety and its part of the reason I am having trouble leaving. I know that this doesn't make sense rationally, but the thought of being stuck for a long time at a homeless shelter seems worse than the violence. ive never been able to get on my feet to a point where im independent even after being on some social services. So I really dont believe i would be able to get on my feet if i was living at a shelter. I think I have a better chance of getting work or working for myself if im not homeless. the homelessness feels worse and more scary than being beaten, so i stay."
"i just started talking about my situation very recently but i havn't told anyone in real life yet. I'm so thankful for this website because I would have never even told anyone without it. I don't see a way out of the situation I'm in unless I can start making a lot of money on my own. The problem is I've never been able to become independent. I feel like I have no other choice at this point, I need to get out of the situation but I know it's gonna take years. He admitted last night he didn't have control over hitting me. He pushes and shoves me regularly but he doesnt see a problem with it"

"He hasn't gotten help which he promised, but he hasn't hurt me for a few months now and I know he's trying to do better.

However, I've still been miserably depressed. We were supposed to move into a new flat but he changed his mind and I feel like he always chooses himself over me/us.

Yesterday he said to stop moaning at him or he would leave me. I asked him what I moan about, other than the living situation, and he couldn't give me an answer.

That comment has taken me back to feeling like I don't have a voice, like I'm worthless. Back to the many times he has lied to me, hit me or worst of all raped me, and when I cried about it and expected him to talk to me about it, he'd shout at me to shut up about it or fuck off. I feel so small."
"Long story short, I'm done being hunted down and tracked. My dream job is hiring and I need a new ssn and name to apply and start my new life.
I do not have any proof of the abuse, threats were made over phone calls. I do not know anyone outside my current partners family. Do I need to pay for someone to write a letter acknowledging the abuse? 
Which do i change first, the ssn or full name? I don't want my new ones somehow linked to the old ones. Abuser made an account on a social security site and locked me out of it. Will they be notified?
Please understand Uber trips are expensive and I want to make one trip to change each, so I need to know exactly what to do.
Thank you for any advice."
I am wondering if there are any Zoom type support groups or private support group forums that won't come up in a Google search. I tried Discord and to be honest I don't know how to work the thing. It is way too confusing. I don't have Facebook or social media  for obvious reasons. I don't even care if I have to pay to be in a group as long as it's really affordable meaning I have no job right now affordable lol. I really am struggling lately. I am a few years out and I really need to start doing real work on myself. I am too freaked out to tell my story on reddit. It is way too identifiable.
"ill jump in it, when i was 15 i was abused
physically &amp; sexually by a man who was 20 (probably emotionally too but i tend to take everyone at face value, so since he talked to me nice i j cant group that in because i dont know). our relationship lasted a little less than a year &amp; the abuse started ab 6 months in.

but anyways, i turned 18 ab a week ago and he‚Äôs never left my mind, theres so many random things that set me off. Im just constantly terrified of everything and it‚Äôs exhausting.

but i went to guitar center today to sell a ukelele and he was there. he got a job there &amp; his manager had him do my order. i stood there just shaking and breathing heavy and it was terrible. just terrible terrible and i feel terrible. i dont know how to react to this. i feel like ive been teleported back in time. the lighting is different like how i remember 2018. i feel stuck."
"Someone I know is being abused and I can't afford to help her in any meaningful way. I just hate the fact that a woman is forced to choose between abuse and homelessness/displacement, two shitty options. Are there no hotel/motel vouchers or any other types of financial help for an abused woman until she can get stable? I'm just so upset that dealing with abuse and trying to leave feels like going from one bad situation to another."
"Can someone explain the difference to me between transitional housing and rapid rehousing? Are there additional options? It‚Äôs all sort of confusing and I had no knowledge of even shelters until last year.

"Hello all. I am having a difficult time with my ex-husband. I left him July 2019, and he began stalking me after he broke in to my apartment in October 2019. I have an NCO, but he skirts the limitations of it as much as possible. I am preparing to move out of state, but I'm having a difficult time obtaining a loan. 

Today, I was out walking my dog and I found my ex two blocks down from my house. Just sitting on the curb. I don't know if he was waiting for me, but I'm terrified he's planning something. Does anyone know of any agencies that will help with the cost of moving?"
"I met a random person in a bar in august march with him until april and felt a great danger and hid it from family. I lived with him until September. Cut all family contact. He was raping me and I was crying and dissasociating, and due to quarantine and smoking weed though life was not real. That I was in some sort of hell.
So, now I am out and I realize the entire relationship I acted as my wrost enemy. Didn‚Äôt talk. Literally became mute like in my past abuse.
So I guess what I am trying to say is how to accept I was stolen by, raped by, hurt by, screamed by, gaslighted by...
How to take responsibility of living with cookoo person for 7 months during covid without asking professional help during time.
How to forgive self for making the dumbest mistakes in sharing a life with a psychopath?
When I will be older, how to live knowing I acted that dissasociated and did not trust gut feeling?"
Long story story I had an order of protection from my husband in North Carolina. He now lives in Virginia and I live in South Carolina with our daughter. He is violent and we are waiting for the judge to sign our papers giving me full custody and giving him supervised visits. He was supposed to be buying a house in Virginia and is now saying he got a ‚Äújob offer‚Äù and is moving here so he will be close. Considering he stalked me and our daughter for years is there anything I can do to prevent him from moving? I am having anxiety just thinking about him being so close all the time.
"Got the call and he told his PO we are still together and wants contact with me in the future. Just like that I‚Äôm his again and honestly thrilled. So I‚Äôm going to leave this thread and others because I don‚Äôt feel like I need them anymore.

Thank you all for the support you‚Äôve given me throughout this month. It seriously helped a bunch when I was going through everything. I hope everyone has a beautiful year and nothing but good energy goes your way. üíú"
"I got out of a relationship near enough a year ago exactly. He isolated me, he insulted me, he tried to make me quit my job, he made me pay him ¬£200 for upsetting him and whenever I tried to leave he threatened to hurt or kill himself and said I was the reason. I've realised that this was not okay and was abuse but I'm really confused if I was actually the abusive one? I took him back out of fear when I knew it wasnt what I wanted and I tried to take my own life multiple times because I didn't see a way out of the relationship. I'm so confused. I've spent an hour trying to work out if I abused him and the only thing I did that matched the list was repeated suicide attempts. I have so much guilt and could do with an outsiders perspective because I never want to harm anyone again even if it's unintentionally."
"It hurts so much. I still love him, and I‚Äôm sure I‚Äôll feel that way for a while. I talked myself out of it three times, but ultimately stuck to my guns because my family has my back. My daughter and I are with my parents for now, and even though it feels like ten steps backwards, I know it‚Äôs the right thing. He‚Äôs not fighting me on it, but he has made me feel very guilty. I truly don‚Äôt believe he means to, because he did willfully let me go, but it hurts seeing him in so much pain. He‚Äôs the victim of childhood abuse, and I think because it wasn‚Äôt ‚Äúas bad‚Äù he didn‚Äôt see that he was abusing me. I still have to go back and get what‚Äôs left of my things, my brother and dad will be with me again so I‚Äôll be safe. This is absolutely the hardest thing I‚Äôve ever done and it feels like it‚Äôs going to hurt forever. Everyone keeps saying it will get better, but they‚Äôve never gone through this before. I hope that time and distance will make me see things clearer, but I just don‚Äôt know."
"I‚Äôm starting my job applications again after relocating from home. A couple questions:

- What do I put as my residential address? I‚Äôve been moving around from place to place. 
- Is it easy to open up a bank account without my dad noticing? How can I do this? (Afaik, my account is connected to his) Should I apply to jobs first, or open up a bank account?
- In what ways might I anticipate having to tell the interviewer about my situation? (Such as ‚ÄúI‚Äôm a survivor of domestic violence, and had to make some hard choices to get out of that situation‚Äù)"
"I'm a detective in England who investigates a lot of domestic abuse cases. A case I am currently working on has brought a certain question sharply into focus and I'm wondering if there are any practitioners on this sub who can answer.

How do you stop yourselves from becoming a tool of abuse?

I'm dealing with a case where I think this has happened. It seems to me that a clever and manipulative abuser might present themselves to a domestic abuse support service as a victim. Clearly, advocates/support workers/case workers, can be leveraged as powerful tools of abuse to gaslight and badger a victim.

My understanding of your role is that it requires you to take what your client says at face value. If that's the case, how do you protect yourselves from being exploited by bad actors?"
"I left my abusive ex husband a few years ago and got divorced. A very conservative/religious ‚Äúfriend‚Äù who I wasn‚Äôt close with tried really adamantly to convince me to change my mind, even when I told him about the abuse... he brushed it off as a minor detail like I was the one doing something wrong/going to hell for it! (Obviously he is wrong and that is horrible.)

This person and I stopped talking after that conversation. But recently, a few years later, he messages me out of the blue ‚ÄúHope all is well.‚Äù Not asking how I am or starting a convo. Just feels like he‚Äôs trying to bother me? 

Anyone else deal with conservative/religious people being weird or rude toward you after leaving an abusive man? 

For some reason this is still upsetting to me.  Like they want to keep bringing up the past."

"Talked to his PO for the first time today. She seems nice but also no nonsense. She told me that the no contact will be modified in April, so in 84 days. Tomorrow she‚Äôs going to talk to him to get things set up based on his plea deal and then she‚Äôs going to tell me if he‚Äôs even interested in reopening contact in the future. 

I‚Äôm really nervous to hear his answer and how I‚Äôm going to deal with it. If he says no that will give me the closure I need. If he says yes...guess I‚Äôll have a lot to figure out on my end.

If anything though I‚Äôm just happy to be in the loop again."
"I have not felt safe enough to go back home after I finally had enough of the emotional, financial, mental, and physical abuse this morning at around 2am when I kicked Narcissist boyfriend (21M) out who had been living with me since April.

I know he is lurking around my apartment complex waiting for me to come back (so he can come knock on my door, harass me, etc.) because he‚Äôs done this before. 

His stuff is still at my apartment which I am more than willing to give but only if an officer is with us watching. 

He has literally laid outside the front door of my apartment for hours without leaving when his name isn‚Äôt on the lease and he technically isn‚Äôt even allowed on property (said directly from my apartments manager)

What can I do to finally get him out of my life for good when I‚Äôm scared to even go home."
My sister's husband has been abusing her the first time it happened she did call the police on him he went to jail only over night and was let right back out. The thing is they live together and she has no where to go. We are not in the same state at the moment so I can not just pick her up and bring her to me. What other things can she do besides getting a restraining order. I have sent her national DV  numbers she said they give her tips on what to do and bottom line is call police. She tried calling a few shelters but they tell her to call back the next day. And it happened again today. What are some numbers help lines or tips I can give her????
"I have been seperated from my EX for over 5 years. 4 of these I have had a domestoc abuse restraining order against him and a child abuse restraining order against him. 

I am in the middle of overhauling our current Child Support, Physical Placement, Legal Custody order... I had the 1st hearing yesterday. My attorney said that he is hiding money and this will now get dragged out longer because of tax returns. I just want it to be over with.

I have put everything on the back burner regarding him for years and in trying up these loose ends and moving forward I feel like I should file a police report regarding the physical and sexual abuse especially involving what happenedgow/when I was pregnant.

I already mentioned it in the restraining  orders but, I feel like that's not enough."
"So without going into too much detail, my friend who is married, and has a child with her spouse, has been getting severely abused for years. My friend is an immigrant and is unemployed, so she is afraid to call for help in the case that her husband is arrested and she is left with no money. I‚Äôm sure there are some programs in place to support her and her child, but I have no idea. Does anyone know what would happen in this situation? Thank you for your help."
"He says he loves me and cries over me. We dated 6 years we share a child but he has done so many horrible things to me in this relationship and everytime I forgive him it always gets worse or stays bad. I don't think he'll ever change.

I don't live with him anymore. I got the protective order. I block him usually but I always find myself feeling guilty and unblocking and talking to him. 

What do I do?"
"I‚Äôve been reading the book! To say I was shocked is an understatement. This is proof that I‚Äôm not crazy and it has made me feel a lot better. 

However, I hate that it also made me realize my ex never loved me. I‚Äôve been doing really good but today it hurts so much. He wasn‚Äôt my first love but it sure as hell felt like it. He was so affectionate and loving when he wasn‚Äôt abusive. I miss kissing his face and laughing together. I miss feeling his legs interlacing with mine in the middle of the night. It‚Äôs like I was living a fantasy this whole time. It hurts. It‚Äôs really hard to believe he never loved me."
"I had been in a relationship with my abuser on and off for 6 years. He is a narcissist. I have been manipulated and gaslighted the whole time. I thought that I was more in control of the situation after learning how narcissists work, but clearly my head has been messed with for so long, that I didn't know what was up or down. Anyway, I had an order of protection against him but still had contact with him. Things were ""okay"" since he had not been drinking. He went on a 2 day alcohol binge and started destroying things in the house. I called the police to have him removed and he fought the police. He is on parole for assault against an officer, now he has more of the same charges. He will probably be going away for a long time. I know I did the best thing for me and my children. So why do I feel so damn guilty?"

I had a week off work at the end of November 2020 due to injuries that he had given me. I was late to work one day at the end of December due to his need for me to stay awake with him on a night. I needed a day off a couple of weeks ago as I had just started prosecution against him and I‚Äôm tired af and stressed af. After I took that day off I was informed I‚Äôm on sickness monitoring. I have just taken the weekend off because I‚Äôve had more time with police and done another statement about him contacting me again (breaking bail for the second time in less than two weeks). I‚Äôm scared to go back to work because they seem to have no patience for my time off. I don‚Äôt want to lose my job. I‚Äôm already in so much debt because of him.
"Are there any online now? I struggle to find some. It's not an emergency now, the Crysis is over. But I need to discuss things.

"Sometimes my mom will hit my dad. For example, when he removed items from the pantry and she came home the next few days and found them missing she slapped him on the arms a few times. Or when he teases me she‚Äôll hit or slap him on the arm to get him to stop. To me, it sounds minuscule, but she still hits him so input from another person would be nice. :)"
"I feel like I am romantically indebted to the guy who hit me one time and cussed at me and took pictures of me naked without knowing and cheated on me and broke my belongings and stole my kids things one time and hid my kid from me once. And told me he used me for sex once.

He's done so many horrible things to me. Yet he pours his heart out and I feel like the bad guy like I owe him loyalty and love. Even though I left I'm still owned. 

I just don't want to exist sometimes cause I don't want to feel like this anymore."
It absolutely astounds me when the abuser goes on like the victim. Like THEY were the one getting abused. Speaks volumes... don‚Äôt you think? How frustrating.
"I left an abusive boyfriend 4 years ago. He has been trying to find my ever since. 

Some time ago I tried to get delivery through one app. It said an account was already made. I backed out and tried a different one. I was trying to set up an account but I must have just logged in. I put in my food order, address, everything... When I went to the payment page, it had his name, his number, and my old address! I was able to remove the info and cancel within 20 minutes. I was so scared, and not knowing if he was notified and saw the info in that 20 minutes, I moved. 

Today, I was trying to sign up as a gig driver. I put in the city I'd be working in and everything. Of course, the account was already set up! I tried a few things but couldn't see what information was saved or where verification was going to. When I called the DV hotline, all they could help with was telling me to call the service and explain the situation. I hope it's open tomorrow...

Anyone else dealing with this?"
"I woke up to a phone call. It was my boyfriend. 8 on the dot. I had to pick him up. So I go. I already know he's angry bc I'm late. I don't try much conversation because of that. I mentioned something about how I wanted to eat. Casually made a noise. It set him off. We came back home and he slammed my car door. I was shocked bc it was hard. Don't damage my only car please. 
Then he continues to yell as if I'm verbally attacking him but I'm not so Im just shocked. He gets angrier and angrier. He keeps growling how much he wants to off himself and I keep telling him nobody is stopping him anymore. Still won't."
My boyfriend has pushed me around a couple of times.. last week was more intense.. he left marks and slapped me across the face.. it doesn‚Äôt sound like much when i say it out loud but he threatened my dog‚Äôs life and mine also.. hes now on 10 month probation to be on good behaviour and if he is abusive in any way mentally emotionally or physically and I call the police he will go to jail... he isnt in our house at the minute and I have also gotten out of town.. i have to go back eventually.. he hasnt touched a drip of alcohol since that night and has also gotten back on his medication and is seeing a councillor once a week as per court order.. he tells me he wants to change not only for me but for himself.. im fighting my head and my heart.. my heads knows i should walk away and not look back.. but i find it hard to sleep at night because in my heart I love him.. anyone else been through this? Any advice on how to gather my thoughts or just to be able to cope?
Has anyone used the Annie word in a pharmacy yet? Was you helped? I don‚Äôt think I can take this crap anymore I think my rib is broken.
"My husband has been mentally abusing me, has been threatening to end the relationship and records it on his phone because he wanted me to say it on tape. I have always ignored him and not engaged but this time he grabbed me for the first time and continued to provoke me. I got so upset and tried to take his phone from him. As I told him to stop recording he caught on tape me trying to obtain the phone from him and in the process I threw an item at him and I also tried to grab onto his clothing to make him stop. The cops came and I got arrested for domestic abuse with injury because he got a scratch in the process. I am the one who got arrested and it‚Äôs on my record now but I feel like I haven‚Äôt been able to disclose the emotional abuse that has been occurring. Advice please. what should I do?"
"Hey, just wondering if there's a way to fully block emails on gmail? I've blocked and had them sent straight to trash for now, but I find myself reading the horrible stuff when I'm feeling weak... Is there a way to completely stop an email address from reaching my inbox? 

If not, is there a way to have an auto-response to only one address in gmail? Like a ""Oops! Looks like this account no longer exists"" to get him bored of it?"
"I‚Äôm currently safe at a friend‚Äôs house after having called the cops on my dad. It‚Äôs been a couple months since then, and I got a text message from my mom telling me that she doesn‚Äôt think my dad would hurt me. It‚Äôs so weird to know things are back to ‚Äúnormal‚Äù at home. I will never forget how scared she looked in her eyes when she told me to call the cops while trying to bar my door with her body.

I feel a little weird tonight. As if I‚Äôve been dramatic this whole time. I don‚Äôt want to go back home, but I feel like I‚Äôm slowly running out of resources to stay away."
"I have no family anymore, which is fine. They've all taken the side of my abuser and abuse runs in my family. I was the black sheep to see it, say something, try to change something. I left years ago so I would never have to return to this family, and I knew it was too good to be true, I came back on a whim. careless. Now I'm trapped. Now I can't leave. I kept my head down as much as I could. I covered up from my dad. Stayed out of the way. I tried to be good to my sibling, parents. But then it starts. When I told my friends, old friends, no one believed me. I hid it so well, for years. But this time I saw it, I felt true fear. And no one wanted to believe me. No one around me can believe it. No one knows what to say.

And now that my abuser is throwing me into the court system, pretending to be a victim. It doesn't even matter anymore. I don't know where my life goes now. I don't know how it'll change. I don't know about anything anymore."
"Mostly the title but I'm also the sole income for the household. M34 and he's M38. I've been trying to get him into VA treatment but he won't go and when I told him he had to leave the house a couple of months ago he refused to eat for days and I had to take him to the ER where he panicked and pulled out his IV. I can't get him help without his acceptance, he won't help himself, and in the meantime I've had to put in notice at my work and basically barricade myself in my room while trying to keep the truth from people I care about so they won't worry and I won't be embarrassed. This is not what I thought an 11 year relationship was supposed to be."
"So I‚Äôm just going to say this. My ex had a lot of things he was very self conscious about and have had multiple ex‚Äôs leave him because of it. Nothing he can control and unfortunately a lot of men deal with but don‚Äôt talk about. It never bothered me.

I was the first woman it didn‚Äôt bother and accepted as soon as I found out. He told me this made him love me even more and only pushed him to forever pursue me.

My main question is this. Since we are on a court order No Contact (about a month now and not sure how long it will stay) and he‚Äôs been through the legal system what are the chances he will continue to pursue me? 

I think I know statistically an abuser will follow their victim but usually that is without the police or legal system being involved. In my situation though I‚Äôm not sure and I want to prepare myself."
"Hi all, 

I hope this isn't breaking any rules. I'm a student developing a tool that provides better access to immediate short-term housing for those experiencing domestic abuse/sudden homelessness. I am working with local shelters, but want to widen my scope and hear directly from people who have lived through these experiences. If anyone here is willing to share their story please PM me and we can set up a time to talk. If you aren't comfortable talking but are interested in contributing feel free to leave a comment. In a perfect world, is there anything external that could have helped you get out sooner? - much love and thanks, RW"
"Idk what happens when the drama and abuse extends outside of the relationship. When other people are being harmed and threatened for just calling or hanging out with you? 

I love him still. I‚Äôm just scared. Everything feels like my fault. That I got others hurt, that I hurt him, that my family is worried but I keep going back. So at this point they get fed up cause I‚Äôm crying every time shit goes down. I feel like happiness is in my hands but then it just slips every time."
"I posted on the assistance subreddit and it was flagged because I guess I don‚Äôt post often enough? 

I don‚Äôt have family left and my friends all basically bailed in the 8+ years we were together so I‚Äôm not sure where to turn. I need to remove myself ASAP as I fear for my life. I‚Äôve been sexually assaulted, etc and the cops are just acting like it‚Äôs ‚Äútwo girls in a tussle‚Äù and not taking us seriously because we are lesbians. 
I‚Äôm sure if she was a man things would be different (but judging from what I‚Äôve read on here who knows. Maybe not) 

Are there any resources available? Every domestic violence shelter around here requires that you have kids and/or you have been forcibly evicted. I‚Äôm at my wits end and I‚Äôm so broken and don‚Äôt know what to do. 

Any advice? I was denied unemployment and they won‚Äôt even let me apply for PUA (gotta love Florida)"
My boyfriend of over a year threatens me all the time and it‚Äôs been getting really bad lately. He allows me to leave and he isn‚Äôt with me all the time but he has weapons and will not allow me to end the relationship. I am seeking advice about PFA.

"Hi, really sorry if this shouldn‚Äôt be here. I‚Äôm going to keep this short because the full story feels like a very long story. I‚Äôve (33M) have been with my partner (44F) for just over ten years, it‚Äôs been my only proper relationship so I don‚Äôt always get if something is normal or not. Here are the head lines:

I‚Äôm not allowed to cook, if I want to use her kitchen I have to be quick and hide my tracks and it makes my heart pound

Not allowed to sleep in our bed. It‚Äôs been about five years now that I‚Äôve been on the sofa, I do snore, but is this normal? 

When we disagree she shouts at me, often in front of the children. I don‚Äôt see the need to shout, we can talk it through, but when she is unhappy she gets loud, and doesn‚Äôt care if the kids are up to hear how shit I am.

There are lots of good times but the three things I‚Äôve mentioned are constants of our relationship, is this normal?"
"When I went into the store, the first time I‚Äôve been out in weeks, of course our song had to be playing and I was tearing up so hard. I broke the second I got back to my car.

"I caregive for a young lady who got married to a airforce man back about 8 years ago. They are currently divorced.

He ended up severely beating her which has caused bad lifelong medical issues.  He went to military jail for 2 weeks and then came back to the home again and again to beat her up over and over.  After him coming back a number of times, the military finally put a restraining order in place.  She was moved off base and was put in an apartment for a while.  The military then dishonorably discharged him and then ""problem solved"", the military stopped helping her completely.  

Because of him and the AirForce allowing him to come back over and over, she has lifelong problems.  While the AF doesn't recognize her as a vet and give her benefits as one, she has been through war and been permanently injured and deserves a lot. Is there anything that can be done for her?"
I am currently stuck outside in freezing cold. Uber to home where it's warm and my bed is like 45 but of course I'm broke cause he sucks me dry. If anyone can help please  cashapp is $ryanschilly
"I‚Äôve been a silent reader in this group for many a years, but I guess it‚Äôs finally time, I‚Äôm leaving him! I don‚Äôt have much time this moment I just was wondering. I have almost enough money for a small house to rent for me and my three children. I will be starting over almost completely. Won‚Äôt be able to take much so he won‚Äôt notice til we‚Äôre long gone. We‚Äôre going states away back to a familiar area I lived in before. Are we allowed to post maybe Amazon lists for donations or help? I don‚Äôt have any family or friends as I‚Äôve been isolated for many many years now and I am getting some help already through some churches and such. I just want to make sure me and my kids have the bare minimum until I get my first paycheck! Even if not please pray for me! I‚Äôll come back on here soon to update. I‚Äôm finally going to be free!"
"Hey reddit,

I'm here because my mom is dating a monster. He's 34 my mom is 55 and he's milking her dry financially. He's also put her in the hospital for strangling her. She refused to press charges. 

It died down or a bit but he's back now and I dont know what to do. I've even told her it's me or him. She chose him. I'm literally speechless. 

I don't want my mom to die. I've called hotlines and have talked to several advocates tellining me that she needs to want help. But I'm worried she won't want help until it's too late. Please tell me what to do."
"I was in a physical and emotionally abusive marriage for 14 years. I finally had enough and filed for divorce about 6 months ago. He has since promised to never treat me that way again, he is going to therapy to see why he was so angry. My question is can abusers change? The abuse wasn't everyday only when he was extremely angry. I know he treated me terribly but why do I have pause? Am I just fooling myself believing he will change?"
I have a friend whos husband punched her in the face. She said it wasn‚Äôt him at all(the way he looked and acted) When the police showed up they arrested him and took him to the mental hospital. They then diagnosed him with schizophrenia. She also said he‚Äôs never been abusive but has noticed signs of schizophrenia. She doesn‚Äôt want him to get jail time but does want him to get mental help. She‚Äôs afraid that if she shows up in court to testify that they will sentence him. Will the case get dropped if she doesn‚Äôt go? Also there was no physical evidence that he punched her. He left no marks.
"Im so confused between coerced sex and rape when it involves a SO. What if you were ""trained"" not to say no. Does that mean its consentual? What if you dont feel like it but they keep pushing till your in the mood? Isnt that okay?"
"Long story short: my parents got into a physical fight the other day. Both my parents are incredibly abusive towards each other and it escalated to the point where they were shoving each other, threatening bodily harm, and throwing objects. I had to physically break them up before someone got seriously hurt. 

I‚Äôm currently in the process of moving out as I‚Äôm financially secure enough to do so. Unfortunately, the earliest move out date for me is March 1. Being at home scares me but my city is on COVID lockdown so there‚Äôs no place I can go. 

I‚Äôm really worried about what will happen when I‚Äôm no longer around to intervene. How much is it going to escalate next time? I‚Äôd feel so guilty if something happened and I couldn‚Äôt stop it."

"Hello. 

I am looking for advice on how to leave my abusive partner. I am mother to a 22 month old and a full time university student with virtually no money. I also signed a year long lease with the jerk and I co-own a vehicle with him because he doesn‚Äôt have a license (insisted on having the loan in his name). I am looking for any resources that can help me get out of this lease, find affordable housing and leave this guy. He also is the father of my daughter but, he‚Äôs a jerk to her too.

"Last night I learned one of my neighbors is beating his wife. I didn‚Äôt actually witness the abuse, so I‚Äôm not sure if I can actually call the cops on him without making things worse.  Everyone on the street knows about it but he doesn‚Äôt know we all know and is still spinning a story about how she got beat up when they went to the gas station when they never actually left the house last night. She had told one of my neighbors, who told my boyfriend, who told me. I haven‚Äôt seen her since it happened but I‚Äôve heard she has very visible injuries. 

Is there anything I can actually do or do I need to witness/hear the abuse to report it and have it actually go somewhere?"

Let's say a high schooler has been hit by their maternal guardian every time they misbehaved since Pre-K. And it's still happening. There are solid rules in place, yet they still won't follow them:

3. Lying
4. Talking back

Currently the dog is still at the home with my husband. My husband has been messaging saying I can come to the house and get her if I like. 

The house is out of town. 

He works in town most days and sally (the dog) comes in with him every time 

I‚Äôve asked to meet in town so I can grab sally 

He says no

"I never shared a relationship with this person.  He is 50 and looks 50. I'm 30 but I have highlander syndrome so I have the appearance of a 8 year old in the face and I'm only 4'11. He's obsessed with young girls, especially those who do pedophilia play.  

I never made any effort to be around this guy. He hacked into my phone so he can control who I can and can't speak to. It's a violation of my boundaries and he has a crazy ex who he caters to.  

She runs him and he allows her to abuse me. 


I reported them to law enforcement, FBI, the internet police, blogs, each platform and there is an ongoing investigation but it seems to he going slow.  

I need encouragement."
"Part of his punishment is having a parole officer which apparently includes keeping me in the loop of his life. So when he goes to rehab I get to know, when he leaves I get a call, if he goes to jail I‚Äôll know. They are going to keep me in the loop which I understand why but at the same time I just want to forget him. 

I asked if they could not contact me but they said for my safety they have to. That and if he wants to contact me after a few months they need to let me know too. So great, even after the trial I‚Äôm going to have to have him on my mind for two more years.

How the hell do you move on from someone when you have to be constantly reminded of them? Is he going to be able to forget about me knowing he has to go to rehab and deal with his side of stuff because I put him there? 

Has anyone else had to deal with parole officers? What was it like for you on your end?"
His lawyer filed for a request for discovery. So I hired a lawyer. To think I was hours away from almost letting him off the hook when he was set out to totally try to assassinate my character and hang me out to dry. After *EVERYTHING* I tried to do for him. Thank GOD I didn‚Äôt delete those photos. Thank GOD for me being somewhat smart and not placing all my faith in a master manipulator like him. Filing charges after all. No more playing around. He deserves *no* more kindness from me. People like him have no accountability and will never change. I hope he rots. The only forgiveness he will have to find now is from God himself.

My counselor called APS on my family today. I am not happy about this . My mom keeps telling me that I will be left out on the street and she will drive away leaving me with no way to get home. I'm 31yo wheelchair user.if she left me alone in the street at night this time of year  I would most likely be unable to keep myself safe.

"My husband can be very violent and abusive towards me. 

It has probably been a year since it has happened. Physically I mean. a month ago he broke through my locked bathroom door. 

I get really embarrassed just thinking about it. I try to block it out. I try to distance myself from him but it's really difficult because I have very severe anxiety and I cope by speaking aloud. 

Can people actually change or am I just getting closer to it happening again?"
"Signal post to anyone who saw my previous posting about neuro issues with acute recurrent memory loss years after leaving abuser. Visible lesions are likely result of repeat head trauma. Feelings of depression, anxiety, confusion, and memory discrepancies potentially exacerbated by stress hormones in brain. Suggestive of successful treatment options. Fingers crossed.

The last few days I‚Äôve been in a positive mood. I still am. But I had the victims assistance paperwork sitting on my desk for awhile trying to decide what to write in time for his court date. Did I want to give him grace and let him off the hook like I had been saying forever? Or did I want to make sure he was held accountable? Having to make decisions on someone‚Äôs life like that was one of the hardest things I‚Äôve ever had to do. I ended up just writing my feelings down. Did I want to be contacted of court dates and sentencing? I didn‚Äôt know what to put. I decided on no. It‚Äôs over. I need to find a way forward.
"My ex attacked me several months ago and once he bonded out, moved to another State. Today I learned he is back in the city I live in and has gotten a job here. I‚Äôm terrified he will come

I had a date come over to my place and right before we were about to do the deed I wet myself like a 5 yr old child. 

It was out of fear I think just the whole thing was overwhelming god it was so embarrassing cause afterwards I had a bit of a breakdown in front of this poor guy. 

My ex abuser would use sex as a way to punish me. He would hit me and try to hurt me during sex.

"Had a fight this afternoon with my partner and told him i was done, a few words were said i said im not doing this anymore and he carried on about me kicking him out and he made threats, he went for a drive and took our 3 year old and said he'd be back to get some stuff, i went for a walk with my 9 year old to get some fresh air, i came home, he came home and he started packing up more stuff, and he's gone!! He said he'd be back to get the rest of his stuff, he left our son somewhere and i didnt get to see him or anything.  Not sure now when i will see him again. it feels weird that i finally had the courage to tell him I'm done,  he was so calm packing up, not sure what he has planned now, that almost scares me just as much, whats he planning,  it cant be that easy!!

She has accused me of some pretty disgusting things that I won't go into, but what I will say is the police are looking to bring charges against her, and I have been told by numerous agencies that I am likely to get full residency of my son.


I learnt today she is in a new relationship with some loser she met online. Is it right that I feel bad and down over this?


What she has done to my family is disgusting and I am glad the police believe my side of events rather than hers.


To be honest I don't even know why I'm posting this as it just sounds like jealousy. I suppose I'm left here wondering how someone can be so manipulative and then move onto another guy like nothing ever happened. Interesting the guy isn't local, as most of the locals know what she has done.


Thanks for reading anyway"
He took the plea of 3 years. So he will be gone for awhile so i know i can be safe and start to build a life again. I hope he wont come after me when he gets out. He is only going to serve 80% of his sentence (in Florida) so it will be more like 2.5 years. Do you guys think he will forget abt me and move on when he gets out? Or do u think he will try to hurt me? Im worried.

A couple of days later she came back and said she went to the police (either police or some kind of organization, I couldn't remember exactly and her English was not so good) and had pictures taken of her bruises on the legs. She said she told the police (or whoever took her pictures) that I did that to her so she could get green card and child custody when it comes to divorce. Then she left USA and went back to China.

"Facts on Women, Children and Gun Violence: 94% of female murder victims killed by men are killed by a man they knew. In other 
words, females are 16 times as likely to be killed by a male acquaintance than by a male 
stranger. In 2010, 1,017 women, almost three a day, were killed by their intimate partners. 2694 children and teens died from guns in 2010. That‚Äôs a roughly equivalent to a Newtown massacre every three days. Between 1979 and 2010, more children and teens died from guns (119,079) than u.s. soldiers in the wars in Vietnam, Korea, Iraq, and Afghanistan combined.

Were these statistics new to you? What are the implications of the correlation between gun possession and domestic violence incidents? What do you think should be done legislatively or through litigation to address this situation?"

Really annoying when it happens but it‚Äôs so much better than where I was two weeks ago. Hell it‚Äôs better than where I was three days ago."
Hi. My husband seems to want to be violent during sex I go to therapy now and my therapist says he has some domestic abuse red flags (I have never told her this!). At first I thought it was a way to spice things up but one night he smacked me so hard in the face I saw stars and also I had massive bruises on my arms. I mean seriously massive bruises. He has never hit me or hurt me but during sex and what I think he thinks is just kinky sex? Or is this maybe a red flag? I do see a lot of controlling behaviors everywhere else (says he will kill me if I cheat on him) and he is just a jerk in general. I would not think he would hurt me though but now I realize how strong he is....thoughts?
"How to be like okay, I didn‚Äôt ask for help when needed and suffered 6 months of rape, financial abuse, verbal, psychological abuse... with stranger.
Like it‚Äôs not okay that I let it happen.
And stayed mute during time.
How do you deal with the regret of not asking for help earlier?
Please?"
"I posted awhile back that my abusive ex was doing the same to his current wife and that I was considered reaching out to see if she was okay. Long story short, she ended up reaching out to me because she was filing for divorce and wanted any info I could provide on his domestic abuse charges. I was happy to give her the info, and gave some encouraging words.

Fast forward to now, and my ex is posting on Reddit about how he‚Äôs going to be lonely this Christmas (of course not mentioning why) and looking for/getting sympathy from people. It‚Äôs taking everything I‚Äôve got to not comment on his posts to call him out for doing the terrible things he‚Äôs done to at least two women now, and who knows to how many before us that never spoke up."
Every single time I've left him (moved out or left to stay with friends) he was silent for days then started completely obsessing over anything and everything he's ever bought me  even right down to a cheap extension cord or dust pan. He called constantly demanding it back. Is this normal? I'm sure it's not. Has anyone else experiences this? Why give gifts of you're going to take them back after a breakup. I'm dreading him doing this after I break up with him again soon and have him leave the apartment.
"Sorry for blowing up this thread but it feels like my one and only outlet right now. I‚Äôm tossing and turning. My heart aches yet I‚Äôm angry. 

Right now I keep thinking about when they say you bring a monster out of them. What kind of bs is that?

If it‚Äôs true that he shut the door on me because he thinks I‚Äôm no good for him or he doesn‚Äôt like who he is around me- that‚Äôs bs. HIS actions are not MY fault. HIS choices are his alone. I loved him IN SPITE of himself. But I bring out a monster in him? So what he rather take the easy way out and ignore the root of his issue rather than work it out with me alongside him? Or just be with someone else until she figures out who he is and keep trading one person for another? If I‚Äôm not the one worth bettering himself over- then he can go to hell. He betrayed me in about a billion different ways. Karma can have him."
"I‚Äôve been feeling so triggered. Only a week after my husband was removed from our home due to domestic issues, I had new neighbors move in. Day and night he is beating her and she is screaming and crying. Maybe twice daily. Thumping noises. It‚Äôs loud. I have not been able to pinpoint which of the possible 2-3 units it could be coming from so I don‚Äôt know how to help. I‚Äôve thought about walking around but then that makes me fearful of my own safety. It‚Äôs always over as soon as it begins so it‚Äôs hard to dial police but it‚Äôs relentless. I‚Äôm so worried about her. &amp; it‚Äôs extremely triggering emotionally. Sadly all I can keep thinking is I wish my husband was here to wrap me up and ease my anxiety over it."
"I left eight years ago. I got a new job on the other side of the country and started over. That first Christmas was the loneliest time of my life, but I was safe. Just me and my dog.
Every year at this time of year I am grateful for leaving. Now I am safe and loved and confident in myself. I'm so thankful for the love and support of my family and closest friends."
"I literally sleep through everything kids screaming doors slamming etc. Two nights ago I jumped out of bed gun in hand after I heard a loud thud from the neighbors up stairs, dude was beating the fuck out of her, like holy shit. 

While the wife called 911, I went and rang their doorbell(Left firearm in nightstand to clarify) at 4AM dude said it‚Äôs not what it seems, I hope it bought her time, 1 minute later police showed up. 


Interestingly enough the day prior the gal stopped by and gave me her number with her and her boyfriends name......... I‚Äôm wondering if she is reaching out in a subtle way. She said ‚Äúwe‚Äôre going out here‚Äôs my number in case you hear anything weird up stairs‚Äù. 


Ugh. The screams haunt me as a grown ass man. Hearing ‚Äúow your hurting me‚Äù ‚Äúfucking stop‚Äù. Definitely wasn‚Äôt a sexual fantasy. Those don‚Äôt involve being slammed onto the ground and bullshit excuses IMO. 


Thoughts?"
"Now, 5 months after he was removed from my home and life, I have started to process what actually happened. 
I was strangled on multiple occasions,
Mainly when he was drunk. I was slapped and hit often. 
Why did I stay? So much shame about it. 
But worse, I think, were the words. The names. The unrepeatable words that still rattle around in my head. 
They are not welcome, and perhaps time will quiet them."
"I actually felt my heart skip a beat and my mood is up. All day I‚Äôve been letting myself slip back into the fog that everything will turn out alright in the end. That everything will be okay.

It‚Äôs so much easier than the pain I‚Äôve been feeling the past few days.

Then I get this message from our friend and I don‚Äôt know how to react."
Has anyone else ever reached out to the other ex's? Today I did and it was the reality check I needed. This was who he always was.
"I‚Äôm so sorry to everyone who relates to my posts. No one should ever have to go through this. Just know this is making you a stronger, better person and whoever hurt you is weak. They will stay weak until they, if they ever, change their ways. 

Their punishment will be that they will forever stay who they are. A sad, pathetic child who can‚Äôt and will never be truly loved. They will push and hurt everyone that tries to the point that they‚Äôll forever be alone; and that scares them. 

While you? You will grow. You will make it through this and thrive. You will rise above them and prove to them that you are too strong for them to push down. You will show them how amazing and beautiful you truly are."
"Those are the lyrics of a song he played nonstop when I was trying to break up with him the whole last year of our relationship. 

The song is from a video game called Bastion. I think about that line nonstop. 

He moved right down the street from me. 
And then had kids before divorcing me. 
He had me on birth control for 15 years because he ""didn't want crotch maggots."" 
I had to get a cervical biopsy while we were together, bc he raped me after having unprotected sex with other women. 

I will never not be afraid of this monster."
"Hi Everyone,

I was in a same sex relationship with my ex girlfriend. The other day she got so upset during an argument that she punched me three times, knocked my glasses off my face and threatened to kill men with a knife. She‚Äôs put her hands on me two times prior to this and said she wouldn‚Äôt do it again but this time I called the police on her and they arrested her. During that time her family and friends were calling me to get her out of jail. People are saying it‚Äôs my fault when I did the right thing. She bailed out and she keeps contacting me begging for me to come home. In the midst of all this I‚Äôm the one to blame for her losing her job and her spending money on bail. I feel so hopeless and confused right now."
"I haven't told anyone else than an emergency hotline. I feel like I should press charges on my mom, but I don't have anywhere safe to stay and my little sister lives at home. Even calling child services feels too disruptive to this dysfunctional family. Then I'll be even more on the receiving end if I don't get out. I can't get out until I get accepted into uni.

I fear mom will get violent. She tried to punch my dad during a one sided argument a year ago. I think she is a narcissist. 

I don't know how to make this stop."

"My sister, a recovering drug addict, recently left her abusive boyfriend of several years. He is psychologically unstable, and has repeatedly threatened her with violence. Most recently he has threatened to upload sexually explicit photos and videos of her to Facebook, and presumably other sites. My mother has called the local police department but they shrugged it off. Any advice for how to proceed?  My sister has been reluctant to file a restraining order against him, probably owing to domestic violence psychology. 

Please help us figure out how to proceed. We're clueless."
"I feel like I am going crazy. My brother and my friends are the only ones who I have seen show even a modicum of anger. I have seen my father very angry before, at bike thieves on our lawn. I have yet to see him angry over what my sisters husband did. He has been calmer than ever. Sure, that can be valued and my sister needs a stable home. But how can he display no animosity towards him? When I speak with him alone all I hear from my father is ""he's made some mistakes"", ""I hope he can learn from this"", ""he's only human"", ""he's sad about losing her"". He had an opportunity to speak with him again, and it was a casual conversation. Motherfucker, he beat your daughter. Show some emotion. Be angry. Get mad. Tell me you hate him.

Someone tell me his reaction is common or reasonable because I am coming to resent him for being so lenient to my sisters abuser."
The detective who took my statement about my assault said they were going to turn it over to their domestic violence division.  He also said that they are going to try to get him for aggravated assault. How difficult is it to get him for an aggravated assault charge when it‚Äôs my word against his?
"I have never met them, but I hear them fighting on a regular basis about 3 nights a week super late. I‚Äôm just nervous that something will happen and I didn‚Äôt do anything about it but I also don‚Äôt want to overstep"
I have a question for you guys. He has two warrants out. One for domestic assault and the other for unlawful photography. It‚Äôs been over 24 hours. I‚Äôm very anxious about him being found and arrested. I have had the locks changed on my apartment and a security camera set up. How do you keep from being anxious or thinking they are on the run? How long did it take for your person to be found and arrested? I‚Äôm getting anxious and a little scared.
I am moving far away from my ex. He has abused me for nearly two years. He has gas lit me. Taken my money. Not contributed. Lied. Gave me STI and cheated and gladly bragged about it. Embarrassed me and goes to his family and friends to tell them about how crazy and mental I am and make fun of me while he‚Äôs at it. He‚Äôs isolated me for 2 years from them. Everyone I associate with is trash. While everyone he associates with is amazing and great and I can only associate with them. If I associate with my family I‚Äôll suffer consequences. I‚Äôm spending every dime to get away from him finally. I‚Äôm tired of it all. I want my freedom not a prison. I‚Äôm giving up everything to get back and away from this. My mom said I can stay with her until I can get back on my feet. Please keep me in your thoughts and prayers I‚Äôm so terrified about this drive and everything. I have never had to give up everything like this for safety.
"I still love him. A lot. 

We‚Äôve been separated now for 3 months. 

I still hurts everyday. 

I had to go to the police and now we are awaiting trial. 

I got into contact with a friend we have in common. Her boyfriend is good friends with my ex. 
Apparently he‚Äôs already moved on (hurts like crazy).
And that he never wants to talk or see me ever again.

I feel a million knives going threw my heart.

How does someone treat someone so badly, have no remorse and move on like nothing happened? 

I hope this girl sees the signs quick and leaves. 

When will I ever get over it? üòû"
"Give me your worst moments. By reading from you, hopefully I can understand mine."
My boyfriend is currently in rehab for alcoholism after a bad night of being mean to me and actually putting his hands on me for the first time. He choked me and I don‚Äôt even think he knew who I was while he was doing it. I am only posting about this because I am now having throat pain and I went to the doctor and just told them I had a sore throat. They told me I have an infected lymph node and gave me some antibiotics but I am still a little worried it could be something more serious. My throat is hurting on one side and up to my ear when I talk and swallow. Does anyone have any experience of this after being choked?
"God is good!!

My protective order has been extended until 2022!!! Yes it may be just a piece of paper but I want him far from me as possible!! God has been good to me thus far and I want to keep it that way! Ladies/Gentlemen when you put god first in your life, pray daily things happen!! He listens! I prayed for those who are going through and went through horrible trauma in their lives everyday, and will continue to do so! Y‚Äôall are special in every way and don‚Äôt let no man/woman tell you otherwise! If they don‚Äôt love you I love you beautiful people!"
I posted here recently about whether I should get my abusive bf to move out or let him stat here to help with bills while I look for a better apartment and I think iv decided to ask him to move out this weekend or next week. I realised what I pay in both of our groceries is what U would pay for a full fortnight's rent without his help anyway. I think him not living here would save me money. I would also feel a lot safer and less stressed out. He told me recently he will move out if I want him to but won't accept a breakup but I think if I just get him to move out and not act like I'll never see him again he will leave more willingly. Then once he is physically out of the apartment I can cut contact. I'm not on a lease btw. It's a crappy old apartment and it's ok between owners. I didn't particularly want to live here alone but I'm willing to at this point.
"I just hope that someone hears it and it helps them feel understood.

"I have court in two days and I‚Äôm nervous as hell. Things have been getting better for me mentally. I still can‚Äôt sleep through the night but I‚Äôm not crying every day. I still have a lot of anxiety and think of him a lot but I know that‚Äôs normal.

Part of me is wondering if I‚Äôm making a big deal out of nothing. If I‚Äôm in the wrong. If he is going to contact me after the restraining order is over; and if he does how I will handle it. A lot of me is just angry at him though.

I‚Äôm just excited to get over being in love with him because once I do I know I‚Äôll be able to fully focus on me and build myself to a better version of me."
"Hi,

My mother was terribly abusive, I was removed from her custody after 16 awful years and her eventually pulling a gun on me in front of witnesses. 

Following that incident she was hospitalized for attempted suicide and involuntarily committed until she was deemed not a threat and stable with medication. Which she promptly stopped taking upon release. 

She tends to either show up at my rentals or send me messages or call me with threats and foreboding messages. 

Most recently, she followed my family across state lines into Louisiana. I know this because she texted it ‚Äúaccidentally‚Äù to my father that she was going to a cabin near us and ‚Äúwanted to hurt me like I hurt her‚Äù. My father did not save the messages. 

So the police say they can‚Äôt do anything, and it seems like they won‚Äôt until she finally catches up to me and I end up dead. 

Advice or resources?"
"how accept, it actually happened, I was actually my worst nightmare in new relationship with abuser?

how to be like ok it happened, now it won't happen again, because I am getting a restraining order and..... 

How say ok I have these bad memories, but it's okay, yes they were real eventhough thought none of what was living was true at time.

How to be like okay, I am alive now live and okay I lived that but it's finished now can feel again like self

how to be okay with bad memories and make them not make you sick and regret not leaving earlier, and regret not being self with abuser?"
"He was very careful to say that Karma would get me.
That Karma would get my family too.
When I zoomed in on that freeze frame,
I could clearly see he was wearing a name tag.
And on it, was written, KARMA."
I want him to want me back. I want to fall into his arms and be love bombed once again. I want to have the rough sex we had. The trauma bond is so real right now. I crave him even though he is so bad for me...
"
Healing? 
How to say sorry to self, yes I lived this experience for many days on repeat same abuse from new stranger.
How to say, I made a huge mistake continuously that lasted half a year by trying to please someone who was actively and mentally destroying me.
How to be like the wrots is over. You‚Äôre working on urself now more than ever and yes u did do way too many mistakes.
You‚Äôre alive and healthy physically.
Now, I will work with u to find self love again.
How do you self love again, after new horrable trauma with a psychopath narcissistic abuse?"
"How to forgive self for living what u lived.
For not asking for help when needed.
How to live now, knowing that u experienced severe domestic abuse?
How do you internally apologize self for what put self in?"
"i'm so tired. for the past month, i've dealt with breaking up with an abusive ex, and trying to get out of my lease shared with him. my landlord has been absolutely terrible by leaving me on read when I told him I needed to move out because of the abuse, prolonging the approval period after spending weeks finding someone to take over during a pandemic to get more money out of me, and scheduling meetings at my apartment without informing me. my ex has done absolutely nothing to help, other than berate me over text. i don't even want to be in contact with him anymore but i have to due to our housing situation. i'm trying to move out, whilst dealing with this, along with feeling completely isolated from everyone. i'm so tired. i have no will in me to continue anymore. i've never been so angry, hurt, and defeated in my life."
"I need advice.

My ex and I had been together for two years. You may have seen the post earlier about me finally breaking it off. I wasn‚Äôt as careful as I should have been and I‚Äôm paying for it dearly. I want to go to the cops but I dont want to for one reason. He has a son with another woman. If I file a restraining order or get him arrested for domestic assault, he will likely never see his son again. I‚Äôm also afraid that he will turn it back on me. I had the guts to hit him back and punch him in his genitals after he ripped my clothes off and took pictures of me. There is a lot more to it. I just need advice."

"My abuser (22M) has been stalking me (21F) and my family called the police tonight when he showed up at my parents‚Äô house, I talked to them and he was arrested on felony stalking and they might go back and pursue charges for the big physical violence events that happened that I went to the ER/was admitted to the hospital for. 

I feel awful about him being in jail, I can‚Äôt even imagine how he feels and what he‚Äôs going through. I really loved this person and I feel like I‚Äôm making everything worse because he started getting therapy and seemed remorseful after I left and now I just don‚Äôt know what to do"
"Today I woke up actually not crying or hating myself! It‚Äôs been so long. I still miss my abuser...sort of. But I find I don‚Äôt care what he‚Äôs doing or how he is doing. He‚Äôs just a passing thought that comes up a bit too much. I know how to deal with those better though since I have intrusive thoughts all the time.

My only fear is that once the restraining order is up he‚Äôll try to contact me and knock down all my hard work. I can‚Äôt be put into that mental place again...I don‚Äôt think I‚Äôd survive it.

I know I‚Äôm not 100% but the fact that I feel even slightly happy is huge for me. I know there is a lot more to go through and it‚Äôs still an uphill battle but I‚Äôm here! I‚Äôm fucking feeling something other than sadness and numbness. I‚Äôm so excited!

It does get better! üíú"
"My abuser throws out put downs in casual convo and I move on like it‚Äôs normal. 
Example, he was asking me this morning if I wanted to go with him somewhere. When I declined he said, ‚Äú what are you going to do lay around all day tweeting about trump? You probably have someone you text about that stuff ‚Äú I didn‚Äôt even ask what he meant, just moved convo forward like it‚Äôs normal to say things like that to people. 
He likes to insinuate that I‚Äôm cheating once in awhile. I feel so fucked up to be accepting this behavior. It‚Äôs embarrassing that I‚Äôm a strong person everywhere in my life but with him. With him, I‚Äôm a weak shell of myself. Fearful and self doubting. Trapped."
And for some reason I‚Äôm the one apologizing to him. He said that he‚Äôs hated who he has become since meeting me. I feel so stupid.
"Dvo was placed on my partners ex girlfriend.

she‚Äôs messaging off her partners account now bringing myself into it. 
she‚Äôs now claiming her unborn baby is my partners which i told him if it is tell her you want a dna test before you communicate further as she‚Äôs a known manipulator. 

he‚Äôs stressing because each time she contacts him he goes to police as his dvo states if she contacts after being told stop it‚Äôs a breech police laugh and go ‚Äúwe don‚Äôt find this threatening‚Äù 

she changes numbers, new facebooks, he‚Äôs now moving because of her. he has to change license plates and trying to sort a new number but she won‚Äôt stop! 

how can i guide him tk the right people?"
I don't know what to do anymore. The abuse is getting so bad. I have a  medical condition to the point that I can't work anymore and I got denied disability.  I have no money and no where to go. Shelters apparently can't accommodate my medical needs. I don't know what to do anymore. I feel so alone.
"I used to be a huge poster here, but my abuser recently got out so I have either changed my account names or started new accounts on every platform.  Anyway, on to my question.  My therapist told me that she thinks I'm the perfect candidate for EMDR therapy and I have my first session in the beginning of January.  I've heard this can be a very intense process that can often take hours to come down from.  So my question is: What should I expect?  Is there any way to prepare?"
"I feel really depressed all the time. How can someone who claims to love me put his hands on me and force himself on me?

He promised he'd get help but has made no effort to. I've found charities that help people with anger issues etc. but he hasn't bothered calling them. All he cares about is playing PS. ""Remind me tomorrow"", he'll say. 

I feel worthless and like a joke, why should I have to even ask? He should want to do anything to restore the love and trust.

It makes me so sad that I've stayed and forgiven him so many times and now have a ton of trauma to deal with and he doesn't give a sh*t. He just told me that if I made him depressed like his actions have made me, he'd just leave. He made it sound so simple. I bet it would be for him.

Crying in bed right now and he's playing PS like always. Hope y'all are having a better night."
"My abusive bf told me last week that if I want him to move out that he will, but that were not breaking up and he won't allow a breakup basically. I'm in a pretty crappy small apartment and technically can afford the rent by myself but will struggle with buying food. Should I get him to move out or wait until I have a job and move somewhere nicer? He has been very violent more than a few times. He is not abuse be everyday but I constantly feel anxious around him even when he's being good. I've also been struggling with sleep. I'm not sure if I can manage a job while he's living here."
"It's been two months since I left my narcissistic boyfriend. I'm now in my own place doing extremely well in college but I find myself struggling with missing him although I know it's just the trauma bond.

"Two years out of a three-year-long abusive relationship, and I finally started abuse counseling yesterday. There was nothing more validating than repeating whatever names he used to call me and having my therapist say, ""He is literally a textbook abuser."" Though I left years ago, there are still so many broken parts of me I've refused to address. I wanted so badly to just toughen up and forget all about everything that happened. Now, I'm starting to understand that remembering is the only way that I can heal. Sending all my love to anyone else who is also starting this journey."
How long does it take to stop missing them? To realize that they weren‚Äôt good for you? To stop crying over them?
"I‚Äôve been in a toxic relationship for four years. I‚Äôve relied on him financially. He‚Äôs been verbally and physically abusive since day one. I didn‚Äôt tell anyone until yesterday and I finally called the cops. I don‚Äôt know why he didn‚Äôt get arrested. He slammed me into the wall and broke the entire drywall. I have been promising myself over and over ‚Äúthe next time it happens I‚Äôm leaving‚Äù and I finally did it. I‚Äôm a mess. I feel guilty, heartbroken, embarrassed, and angry. I‚Äôm back living at home with my mom. But I finally did it. Reality is really setting in."
"I left my abuser who almost killed me about a month ago and I was extremely concerned about where I was going to go given the financial abuse and the fact that he basically destroyed our last apartment. 

HOWEVER, I got approved today for my own apartment in a really nice community. I‚Äôm moving in tomorrow after staying with friends and in hotels for the past month. It will actually be my first time living on my own. I‚Äôm nervous, but this is actually the first time I‚Äôve felt excitement in years! 

I didn‚Äôt think I‚Äôd be able to move forward, but it‚Äôs actually happening."
"If the police dont pursue anything I want to out him. I have a video of him threatening to punch me in the face. I want his friends, his family, his work to know who he truly is.

"When I leave-


No taking criticism

No being questioned

No defending yourself

No constant arguments

No abuse

Being able to make your own decisions

Being able to do what you want and when

Being able to build amazing relationships with the kids again and your family.

I wouldn't call what you have a relationship sorry :(

You aren't intimate, he has no respect for you, you don't have shared finances. He is more of an unwanted guest that is bumming off you. He needs you more than you need him

My husband is very abusive I'm leaving in a country I'm not a citizen of with him. I have no family here. I left my home county to fleaing my regliously abusive family. I can't get anyone else in the country to sponsor me without leaving. If I leave here I will be homeless in my home country hiding from my family. I'm chronicly ill and constant pain. My husband won't pay for my medical care and I can't get insurance I'm undocumented. The hospitals here are supposed to see everyone even if you can't pay but they turn me away and my husband let's them. I'm going die slowly in this crap hole with stuck with my rapist I just know it.
"He posted bail and has been telling his friends he wants nothing to do with me. I feel heartbroken and so sad. I still love him even though he choked me out. There were so many good memories and then it got all fucked up in a drunken rage.

I want him back but he doesn‚Äôt want me. So I‚Äôm going to do my best to try and move on. It does get easier every day...sort of. Today I took the step to delete my fb and messenger. He has my phone number so if he really wants to get into contact with me after the restraining order is up he can.

Until then it‚Äôs trying to find ways to distract myself and make the days go on until I find I‚Äôm not thinking about him at all."

Why did it happen during covid while isolation was what I was doing.
Why?
Why?
Now I need to live with this experience. 
It was too long!!!!
Noone there for me.
No person, no human.
Only a girl who never cared about me.


Now, I am becoming worse every day!
This is what the narc/psycho wanted.
Now, regret is eating me up."

He also pushed my brother on the floor one time."
"Hey guys, just looking for some advice.

My neighbor at the back of the house has two teenage kids, a son and a daughter. Multiple times a week the son looses all control and starts shouting abuse and being threatening towards his sister, mum or girlfriend. He breaks stuff and even starts throwing things at them. I can hear the arguments and destruction very clearly as it's an old open queenslander. I am concerned for their safety as he gets so angry, he doesn't even talk any more he just growls and grunts as loud as he can and will keep throwing things. He jas already broken most of the windows facing our side of the house. I have been thinking about going over when he's not home to see if they are ok but not sure if that's the way to go about it. Any advice would be appreciated. I'm in Aus by the way.

Thank yoy"
Just wait.  In time you‚Äôll see who‚Äôs really abusive and crazy.
"I left my abusive ex several years ago, but he has continued to harass me and make threats since our separation. 

While we were together he was physically, emotionally, and sexually abusive. He tracked me via my phone, beat me, raped me, and broke my rib in one instance as well as threatening me with firearms and threatening suicide if I left him. 

He still periodically harasses me via text and the internet, threatening to show up to where I live, my parents house, or my place of work. When I block his number he changes it, uses friends phones, or pays to use apps that can text and call me from a different number. 

Two days ago he threatened me and I finally had enough. I called my local police station and now have a restraining order in the works. 

I just wish I could be there to see his face when he gets served."
"If I had the money I‚Äôd bail him out. Instead I have to wait till the 16th to give my part of the events because the most he‚Äôs going to get is probation. A week has never felt so long.

The thing I‚Äôm worried about the most is that he‚Äôs never going to want to see me again. I‚Äôm still so in love with him and just wish his arms were still around me. I wish we never drank and I wish the cops never saw the marks on my neck. I just want things to go back to how they were."
"Any advice for what you wish someone could do to help intervene in an abusive relationship? Their partner is getting lawyers and police falsely involved and framing them, there were a lot of triggers for me...  I'm tired of yelling at them and trying to ""snap"" them into ""reality"". This is their reality and I just need to be there for my sibling when we go to the police tomorrow for the statement. 

Sending love your way."
"Would catching one person threatening another's safety i.e. ""Im going to beat the shit out of you"" be enough to get an order of protection? Also Ive heard these can be instantaneous in some cases. Ibe tried legal advice but the answers were a little hazy."
My husband is my abuser and sexually assaulted me. I already had to face him once in court and he looked CRAZED and that was at the order of protection hearing. Now we are getting divorced and I will have to face him idk how many times. I had nightmares about him almost non stop since i got the order and I'm terrified of what will happen when it's over. We have 2 kids together so I cant just cut him off. I feel so weak and like I cant do this. How do I face him in court?

"So a bit of a background check: I came from a country where domestic abuse upon children is looked upon as normal and to 'discipline' them. I was beaten with fine sticks, belts and bare hands by my father since a young age.. sometimes to the point where I bled. I am now in the UK *somewhat a safe heaven* so he cannot hurt me here..  but he has attempted to murder me once in UK. In the next five years they plan to move back to our country and I plan on getting a job and ending relationships with them once and for all. My mom is very manipulative and emotionally hurts me by calling me 'crazy' under her breath. I heard my dad saying ""She will see what I intend to do in *insert country here*"" he says threatening thinks and he is a threat to my life, he poses a threat to my life. I will not believe their lies."
"Title says it all really, how did you find the courage to leave?

For context my partner is in prison, is due to be released before the end of the year.
I am at breaking point when it comes to the arguing and bickering on the phones. I know we love each other but the verbal abuse towards each other is becoming unbearable. 

We both have tempers and my partner has been done for domestic abuse previously (not with me)

I just need someone who I can talk to with no judgement, I need advice and I don‚Äôt know where to turn to or who to talk to anymore I am at breaking point"
We were drunk and fighting so the police got called. They saw marks on my neck from him and said it was mandatory to arrest him because of it. I‚Äôm with family freaking out because I didn‚Äôt want him to be arrested and I don‚Äôt know how long he‚Äôll be there. I‚Äôm from Oregon so our laws can be different. I care so much about him and love him so much. Right now all I want is to be with him...
Firstly i want everyone on this sub to know that I am praying for them. 2nd I am doing a paper for school on domestic abuse and was wondering if anyone wanted to share their thoughts/experience on the topic?  Why it happens or just anything pertaining to it that I can include.Thank you all. God bless.
"How do you do with horrible memories?

How do you make them stop hurting you in the now?

"I was reading today about cognitive behavior therapy (CBT) and I found a link about cognitive distortion and it sounded just like me after years of gaslighting, physical and emotional abuse exc.... does anyone know if DV can lead to cognitive distortion or other cognitive issues?"
"In a 5 year relationship, the physical abuse only happened twice.

The first time after one year together, where it was mostly items thrown in my general direction and slight bruising on the arm after being pushed.

Second time is after 5 years together, which was a lot more violent.  Punched in the face twice, and various other bruisings on different parts of the body.  

Apart from these two isolated incident, there has been no problems.  Not even mental or verbal abuse.  Does this still warrant breaking up or should we continue working on it?"
Long story but here goes.  F 31 unable to leave home for medical/ financial reasons. I feel afraid all the time my mom watches me. I honestly can't put my finger on it but her just being near me is frightening. I feel like I'm crazy because when I can't stop my anxiety from showing she always asks what I'm so anxious about.  Then tells me my life is so peaceful. I obviously can't tell her it's the way she treats me and my family life.  I feel so crazy.
"So I am in an ENM relationship with a woman (let‚Äôs call her A), who is married to a guy (let‚Äôs call him Z). They are in an open marriage, with Z dating upwards of 5 others and A dating me alone. 

This works for me, this works for her and it partially works for him. 

I see DV in their relationship. Minimal physical, but a lot of coercive control. I have spoken to her a bit about this, but it is dismissed with some acknowledgment. 

I have seen this pattern happen before, and really want to ensure that it does not escalate for her. 

At this point, I am considering sacrificing my relationship with her to make sure it doesn‚Äôt escalate. 

I guess what can I do to make sure she is safe."
"Hey, I just thought it would be amazing if anyone who was the child of domestic violence and broke the cycle would come out and tell their story.
Often we see articles saying that this cycle can‚Äôt be broken, that if you see violence in your home growing up you will most definitely repeat that pattern. And yeah, that could be the case, but I believe that there are some survivors out there who went on, healed and now lead a happy life with happy family on their own.
So please, if there‚Äôs anyone like this, anyone who‚Äôs experienced his dad beating his mom or otherwise on regulal basis in their childhood but decided not to repeat the pattern and found a partner whom he is happy with, PLEASE speak out, it will help many of us to hear some positive storiesüòá"
"Hi there! I'm looking for ways women can stay safe in environments where there could be violence. I had seen posts about these things circulating years ago but I cant find anything through google searches. The kind of information I'm looking for is along the lines of:

Not wearing lanyards/scarves around your neck as they can be used to strangle you. 
Wearing ponytails can give people an easy handle, is its best to wear your hair down/loose. 
Always position yourself closest to the door.

Can anyone think of any other ways to be safe?"
Got 11 stitches in my head. I could use some uplifting words right now from people who understand. Thank you.
" An important woman in my life is involved with a man who is psychologically and emotionally abusive. He's never hit her but he has followed her, constantly belittling and demeaning, accusing her of cheating, yelling/screaming and he recently bought a recording device to monitor her communications and a tracking device for her vehicle. She left for a couple of days. She said she recognized all of the unhealthy behavior and was prepared to leave him for good. He convinced her that he only bought the surveillance equipment because his therapist suggested it. She has returned to the marriage. I begged and pleaded with her to choose herself and not return to a home where she hides from him out of fear. Is there anything I can do? Or do I just have to walk away?"
During an argument he started shouting at me less than an inch close to my face (he‚Äôs done this a few times before) so as he was screaming whatever he was screaming at me I was screaming to back up away from me and he refused to. I started to try to push him back a bit and he started punching me in the chest &amp; screaming for me to hit him so he can hit me back. When I tell him I feel like im being abused by my husband (I didn‚Äôt say I AM being abused i said i feel like I‚Äôm being abused) he laughed at me and said im just playing the victim &amp; that he only hit me cause I hit him first. I feel like there‚Äôs no talking to him. I don‚Äôt know what to do I feel like im not strong enough to just break things off on my own. He really doesn‚Äôt feel like he‚Äôs abusing me or being abusive at all and that I‚Äôm just this huge b***h that nags at him for no reason &amp; he ‚Äúmatches my energy‚Äù
"The situation isn't good, I was just informed today by my mother that my cousin was forced down and beaten/slapped viciously white they were drinking at home earlier this year. She has since quit drinking and he is still a raging alcoholic apparently. He also tried to physically assault my little cousin at his dads birthday.. his dad who had stage 4 cancer and is dying... This asshole started trying to instigate a fight with an 18 year old kid who's father is dying at a public restaurant.. 

I would beat this excuse for a man out of his life if that were a viable option but I know that solves nothing and doesn't help my cousins situation at all. She is &amp; has always been poor, lived in terrible conditions and the situation was always desperate. I can see she is struggling and doesn't know where to turn for help. She has told her mom that she wanted to leave him but it never came to fruit. 

How can I help? What can I do? Where do I start?"
"So recently my son hit me multiple times, leaving me with a big black eye and bruises on my arms and legs. The black eye will take 1-2 weeks to heal but probably not before my sick leave has ended. What do I say to the people at work when they ask about it?"
"\*\*Trigger Warning\*\*

It's been five years since my abuser choked me, held a knife to my throat, and wouldn't stop hitting me.  He had previously raped me several times, took my car keys and phone so I couldn't leave or contact anyone, and told me if I ever escaped he would kill me.  I escaped and ran to a neighboring home to call the cops and he was in jail for four years when he broke his probation.  He's been out for a year now and I had regained control of my fear and emotions, or so I thought.  Today I saw his page pop up on one of my social media accounts and I lost it.  Deleted the whole account, and all day everything he did to me has been circling in my head on repeat.  Suddenly I'm thrust back into the constant fear of him finding me and all I want to do is leave my state and everything I know behind me.  How do I get over this?  I thought it would get better with time but just seeing a picture of him rehashed all the traumatic feelings I thought were behind me."
I have a hearing in a couple of days and just want to be prepared for what kind of information the judge will be asking for. Specifically regarding children and if there are any parents who have wanted to maintain no contact between them but allow visitation for the children.

"Is anyone aware of an online support group for people who left an abusive relationship with a narcissist? I've done some googling but I'm a little nervous so I wanted to come here to see if people had any first-hand recommendations. It seems like most of what I was finding was groups for children of narcissists, which is fine, but I'd like to find one for SOs/former SOs if at all possible.

It's a long story (I typed it out, not sure if I'll post or not), but I got out of an abusive relationship in February of this year and I'm still really struggling. I am pretty positive that he was/is a narcissist and that's why this happened. I have a good support system for this IRL, but nobody who's been through what I have, so I still feel kind of alone, anxious, and scared. Any help would be appreciated!"
"After calling the cops on my dad this week for saying that the family was ‚Äúgoing to vanish‚Äù after having a hysterical breakdown, I‚Äôm now in a safe place I think where I can try to process things. I‚Äôve been in contact with my therapist, and discussing feelings of guilt with her.

Throughout the day my feelings will change from ‚Äúthis was the right call to make‚Äù since the statement he made had me scared for my life because I knew there was a gun in the house, to ‚Äúthis was so dramatic of me to call the cops since no one was killed, and the cops didn‚Äôt arrest anyone‚Äù.

My therapist says that ‚Äúat least no one‚Äôs life was lost‚Äù is a pretty low bar to have to not feel guilty, and I agree. I‚Äôm just wondering if it‚Äôs normal to feel this way."

Everyday for the last 3 months he‚Äôs been messaging me from fake accounts, multiple emails and calls me from an unknown number everyday multiple times. I continue to block him but getting this gift today made me emotional. How can I continue to stay strong and not respond to him? This has been the hardest relationship for me to move on from."
"I'm 33 years old and disabled due to my mental health problems. I used to rent this place from my father. My mom died unexpectedly and he moved in fully. He is choleric and abusive, both mentally as well as physically. I've been looking for a new place on my own for such a long time and it never works out. Might be because I'm unemployed and prescribed ill for a while now (and will be until January) and people being judgmental without even knowing me. When they ask why I want to move out in person, I said im 33 years old and want to live on my own. Would it be wiser to just say that I live in a domestic violence situation or not?"

I've had 2 encounters with my closest friend (and roommate) that have me wondering. He's an MMA fighter.

The second time, he sat on me (and was actually both choking me and sitting on me in a way that I was actually struggling to breathe), and joked repeatedly that he knew exactly how to kill me and that it would be so easy.

"Hi all,

I'm not going to go into too much detail here but I've witnessed domestic abuse between parents growing up. They are now separated and the victim is safe, however it's not been something I've been able to forget and recently it keeps coming back and I've been trying to think of ways I could help people in similar situations. 

I'm studying computer science so I thought one of the ways I could probably do something is to create a program and I've came up with an idea I thought could be quite useful but I wanted to get other peoples opinions on it. So my thought was a google chrome extension that closes all browser tabs and pulls up a web page of the persons choosing when a keyboard shortcut is pressed allowing the victim look online for help with the ability to hide it quickly if the abuser is in the room. Again I thought this could be helpful for some people but I would love other peoples input on whether they think it would be useful or not.

 please stay safe all &lt;3"

My girlfriend's sister is in an abusive relationship. She has been abused physically and mentally by her boyfriend.

"My husband, who I didn't know long enough before we got married, showed a very dark side of himself after we where married, i noticed his dependency on alcohol and had some bad times. For example the one time he was crazy drunk, got mad at me and caught me in a chokehold to stop me from leaving the house ( i manage to get out) he obviously blamed it on the drinking. He stopped drinking a few weeks ago and now he's smoking weed all day (that I would have thought would make him calmer) the thing is that in an argument we where having, he just came to me in full rage with his fist up, he didn't hit me but isn't that a very concerning line to cross? There's no way to communicate with him, or for him to acknowledge something wrong he's done, because he says it makes him feel bad and that I have to let go."

"Hi everyone,

I wasn‚Äôt too sure where to post this but I thought this would be a good start. 
My mom is getting a divorce from my violent step-father (my brothers father) and she is trying so hard to get my brother out of there. She is scared for his life and safety. 
Unfortunately child protection services isn‚Äôt doing anything to help because he was abusive towards me (a stepchild) and therefore they think he won‚Äôt be violent towards his own children. Anyways, now child protection services wants an interview with my brother but my mom thinks his father will kill him (my brother)if they get to talk to him. I suggested making an anonymous tip to the police but I‚Äôm not sure what she‚Äôd have to say to them or if they‚Äôd do anything since he is really good at putting up a front and acting sane. Not sure what to do. Any help is appreciated. 
Thank you."
"I left my abuser on the 21st. Since then I've had uncontrollable heartburn, and even though my belly has been rumbling I just can't swallow any food I put in my mouth. 

I'm actually quite overweight, and because I've gone from lots of calories to barely 300 I've dropped a fair amount of weight in 3 days. 

I'm an anxious person, and I'm worried this feeling won't go away. 

My mum ended up with anorexia after she left my dad, and so did my gran when she left my grandad so I just think I'm predisposed to disordered eating one way or another. 

My family are commenting on how they've seen that I'm not eating and I know they mean well. They're my support right now. But it's putting me off even more. 

I hope this is the right place to put this. I just don't know who else to ask about this stuff."

"I couldn't believe the person I loved hit me, the first time I blamed her medication, it always made her drowsy and loopy, I dealt with a day of stomach pain and she profusely apologized. The second time though, she slapped my face with her open palm and scratched at me until she drew blood. I saw the pattern and I reported the incident to the police. I don't want to ruin her life, but I saw the patterns, I knew I couldn't be another victim of forgiveness towards the abuser. I made sure it was nothing more than in incident report with no attempt at pressing charges. I hope one day abusers realize what got them there and attempt to fix it. The worst feeling is that its the emotional betrayal that hurts, not that she drew blood hurting me."

"I posted a few years ago about trying to get my sister to leave her husband. 

He was deplorable. I don‚Äôt need to go into detail to trigger people but for 4 years I didn‚Äôt know my sister, my best friend. I didn‚Äôt even have a phone number for her. 

Well last year it finally happened. She upped and left with the help of my family. Risking her life in the process. She moved hundreds of miles away to be near our parents. The children are safe and he will never see those children. 

This summer I took her on holiday. I took her on a private yacht and played ‚ÄòGet Free‚Äô by Lana Del Rey on the speaker. We shed a little tear together, because maybe now she wouldn‚Äôt have even been alive, let alone be on a yacht with me if she had stayed with him. 

I have my best friend again and it‚Äôs beautiful :)"

"I left and moved to another apartment. I put in a protective order. My kid was never harmed during the dv. CPS took my well cared for child and won't stop terrorizing me now. They are worse than the abuser!

"Left an abusive relationship 3 months ago when stbx became obsessed with getting a gun (He was severely physically/sexually/emotionally abusive) - the last straw.  I left with my young daughter, and moved in with my grandmother, looking to get my own place.  I got a new job, and its going quite well.  But he still calls me ""hunny"" when I talk with my daughter.  Why does he do this?  He hasn't accepted that I've left and am not coming back.  Sorry if this is jumbled my head is kind of all over the place right now."
"My friends and family are unaware of the physical, emotional, and verbal abuse I endured. I was uncomfortable in confiding in them because during certain occasions they have made comments such as, ""she could have left if it was that bad"" or ""she was disrespectful to her boyfriend/husband"" about other women who were experiencing abuse as well. I tried communicating to my sister what had happened, and she blatantly disregarded my attempt. This has caused a disconnect in my relationships. I do not know how to address that their comments were hurtful. I have not spoken to them in awhile."
"About ten years ago my college boyfriend abused me physically and sexually. I told my best friend (a friend since childhood) and she told me she didn‚Äôt believe me and that he would ‚Äúnever do that‚Äù. She was (and still is) dating his best friend. As you can imagine, this has rippling effects in my life. I ended both the relationship and the friendship. I was scrolling Facebook and accidentally came across a recent photo of the two of them at a football watching party. It sent me down a rabbit hole where I saw things I didn‚Äôt want to see: like how he recently bought a house, is in a relationship, etc. I feel like it‚Äôs caused me to spiral a bit in terms of how I feel about my ‚Äúpart‚Äù in it given that he‚Äôs doing so well and they‚Äôre such good friends still. Anyone experience something like this? Could use some encouragement."

"Its 2020. ""Family courts are now recognising the severe impact on children, of domestic violence""...except mine apparently.

So my ex beats and rapes women (yes that's plural), denied it each and every time, shamed the victims publically through news outlets and media, as well as in court, made me explain why I committed a crime when I was 14 years old (over 20 years ago!) And I have had to prove I am a good person and productive member of society. He however has denied all his violence across many states and more than one woman, called us all liars and crazy...publically. is living off government money unemployed, in public housing yet it has been decided that he is a perfectly safe individual for the children to be around.

What the actual fuck is wrong with the world?!"

My family won't leave us alone, they keep abusing us in many different ways and we can't live like this any longer. I'm afraid they will kill me if I stayed in my country any longer.

"Ugh! They moved my abusive (physically and emotionally) ex to a halfway house! Now he won‚Äôt stop calling me. I told him that I don‚Äôt want to be involved with him at all. He just laughed!

"Hi, I‚Äôm a 27F and I‚Äôve been married to my husband for 2 years. When he‚Äôs in good mood, he‚Äôs not abusive but his temper is very unpredictable. When he‚Äôs mad, he would destroy everything he can and he also beats up my dogs. He has threaten to kill my dogs on multiple occasions. I don‚Äôt know how to get out of this. I can‚Äôt call the Domestic Violence hotline and I‚Äôve tried to contact them via chat but the wait time is always too long. If he knows I‚Äôm looking for help, he‚Äôll probably be mad.

"She didn‚Äôt come out and say it to me, but I‚Äôve been talking to my fianc√© (aka her brother) about the red flags we noticed and we both came to the conclusion that we think she‚Äôs being abused. Not long after we get a call from her mom saying she worries the same thing. 

What do we do from here? The thing that pushed it over the edge for us is it seems like her bf is trying to get her to cut us all off. She got a new phone number without telling anyone, and when her mom finally got ahold of her and got the new # my sis in law begged her not to give the # out to anyone else in the family. This is not like her at all. What can we do? How do we help when I don‚Äôt think she even realizes what‚Äôs going on?"

My boyfriend and I just moved in several months ago. I should have noticed the red flags but I ignored them. He is constantly in fits of rage. He gets mad that I put the dishes away wrong and throws my computer across the room. I accidentally knocked his plant over (it was fine) and he kicked my bicycle and broke it. He constantly explodes into fits of rage over things like the wifi not working and the neighbors complain. When I get frustrated and scream at him to stop he calls me crazy. I need someone to tell me I‚Äôm not. I need someone to tell me it‚Äôs okay to leave.

"Now that I‚Äôve left my husband, I‚Äôve felt a weirdly over exaggerated sense of joy from wearing earrings. I was too scared to wear them during the last years of our relationship since he would hit my ears, causing multiple otohematomas, and eventually permanently disfigured my left ear. I was also scared he would just pull them, splitting my earlobes. He liked to bite me too, so it wasn‚Äôt far-fetched. I‚Äôve always loved over-the-topish earrings and it‚Äôs one of the few pieces of jewellery that doesn‚Äôt interfere with my work.

"My husband stoop so fucking low today. 

Background: he‚Äôs an alcoholic and last Wednesday he hit me so hard that my nose broke. I forgave him and he said he‚Äôd get help. 

The problem is that he won‚Äôt be able to attend rehab until Monday. So he continue to drink while I stayed at a friend cause I‚Äôm just so done with it. 

Last night he went on a bender - got his mom worried. His mom called the cops and ambulance cause she was concerned. I was at a friend‚Äôs minding my own business. 

Woke up today with a message - I‚Äôm done. He thought that I had called the police on him. 

Today, he‚Äôs still drinking and going on a bender (withdrawal so he has to I guess till Monday). 

But he wanted me to come over to someone‚Äôs place so we can have ‚Äúfun‚Äù. But turns out he only wanted a picture of me sucking someone‚Äôs dick so he can blackmail me. That was so fucking low. 

Even though there‚Äôs a police order on his good behavior.

Everything‚Äôs fucked now. I didn‚Äôt think he would stoop that low."
My girlfriends dad is physically abusive to her mother. Me being 18 i grew up in a household where i was taught to protect women at all costs.

"Re: rape and violence

My first relationship was really awful. He abused me in every way imaginable. Raped me and I'm pretty sure he tried to kill me towards the end. 

I've been in a new relationship for the past eight months, one where I'm loved and respected. 

Last night I dreamed that I had the relationship I'm currently in but with my ex. It was like he was copy pasted over my current partner."
"Hey everyone! One of my bestfriends just left her 26M fiance due to DV. They were together 10 years. He only became physically violent this year and she only just told people(her mom, me, a family friend) this week what was going on. 

She's reflecting on the relationship and saying things like she feels stupid for not seeing the signs early on. She isn't ready to consider pressing charges and seems afraid his family might get involved/start messaging her when they eventually find out she has left.

Right now I'm just listening; telling her it isn't her fault, I'm proud of her and love her. She's already committing to some therapy and is steadfast in her resolve to be done. 

My question for this subreddit is 2 parts:

1.)When you left what was the most helpful thing someone said or did for you?
2.)Is there anything I should avoid saying/doing that as an outsider I think is helpful but is really not?"
Mine hasn't been so far everything has just gotten worse
"So, I have a friend who is in love with his gf but yesterday she hit him, broke his glasses, and in my opinion she's gaslighting him. He also has a mental illness and she WORKS for a mental health clinic. 

Me, my friends brother, and my friends mother are trying to get him to come home but he keeps saying it's his fault. 

I don't know what to say. I said my piece but I'm afraid I did the wrong thing by telling him to leave. 

How in the world do you convince somebody to leave, who, by the way isn't on medication?

Do I just have to wait for them to leave, and I can't call the cops b/c I don't know their address. I'm just really, really worried for his safety.

Any insight would be appreciated and I can answer more questions if need be. Thank you."
"It was so much better when I just dealt with things. At least then I had my family. Now I have nothing.

- Primarily experienced significant emotional abuse with some physical abuse, although he never actually hit me

A lot of the groups I‚Äôve seen seem to be more focused on physical abuse of married women, often with kids and a family to worry about. Just thought I‚Äôd check to see if there is anything out there that might be more applicable to me."

"I‚Äôll keep this short. I‚Äôve got a few gaps in my employment history and I don‚Äôt know how to explain them. Given my particular circumstances I would imagine not.

I suffered physical and sexual abuse and my capacity to keep consistent employment subsequently diminished.

I‚Äôm 25 now and completing my postgraduate degree so I‚Äôm a bit behind my peers on work experience. I‚Äôm going into the legal field and I know my resume (and I guess, I) will be heavily scrutinised. How do I answer the potential (inevitable?) question:

My partner also said that he will contact my friend of an emergency, if needed, assuming through an attorney. We also talked about a lot of stuff - I don‚Äôt remember what - but would this ever be used against us?

It‚Äôs 1am here in Australia and I just can‚Äôt sleep. I think I did the right thing but why do I feel so guilty about it... 

I‚Äôm just very emotional right now"
"I have filed for a domestic violence restraining order against my ex. I have had the sheriffs department attempt to serve it, but to no avail. I know the address in which he is living (his mothers house). The sheriff described his mother (who answered the door) as non compliant and she refused to even take a business card. I know that if I continue to have sheriffs attempt to serve, she will say he is not there and cover for him. I would prefer law enforcement to be the once serving as he is a angry, violent gang member who carries a gun, and I don‚Äôt want to risk anyone else getting into a hostile environment and risk their safety. I am 6 days from my court hearing to put the permanent DVRO in place, but he still hasn‚Äôt been served. I know I‚Äôll need to request an extension, but at this point, is there anything I can do besides repeatedly have sheriffs attempt to serve him and hope that his mom will give in and stop covering for him when she sees law enforcement at the door?"
"Inventions/apps/regulations etc.

"After not hearing from my ex for over a year, because he was in prison and then actually following parole, he‚Äôs contacting me again.

Texting, calling, leaving voice messages, with veiled threats and accusations. Every couple months I run in to him or randomly see him on the side of the rode I‚Äôm driving. I was told it was a) either my imagination or b) coincidence. Well, now I have proof from the escalating phone calls. 

I‚Äôm going to report him today. It‚Äôs just never easy. You think it‚Äôs done and it‚Äôs never over. So, I‚Äôm working up the courage to contact the police and let them know and then go through the court processes all over again. 

Wanted to share my experience, that while it takes a lot to leave and report and never go back. It also, continues to take a lot each time the abuser comes back."
"I'm not in an abusive relationship. I'm out safe. I've emotionally healed... mostly. But the one thing that continues to torture me is that there's no guarantee I won't end up with an abuser--again--and that I already did everything I could the second time around. I want to be happily/healthily married, though, so I know it's necessary to (gag, outside the context of abuse) re-enter the dating world. There are so many that keep ending up in abusive relationships or give up on dating altogether. I'd like to avoid *both* fates.

In today's world, everything is virtual. Surely there's enough people globally to get together and support each other through this? Is there any such group that deals with this that already exists, or would anyone here be interested in something like this?"
"I wanna leave my husband. Last night he got so drunk that he threw a plate at me. I‚Äôve always wanted to call the cops on him but chose not to every time. I suffer in silent because I don‚Äôt want him to get arrested or charged. 

I feel so unsafe in my own home now (every time he drinks) 

I want a divorce but I don‚Äôt know what to do. I feel trapped. 

He woke up today as if nothing happened and I‚Äôm breaking down in tears. 

I get PTSD from his drunken behaviours and he doesn‚Äôt let me heal. 

I want this to stop - but I‚Äôm feeling stuck and there‚Äôs no way out"
"My exgf and I are still friends and she is being abused by her new bf. Everytime it happens she calls me. Asking if I can pick her up, but I really don‚Äôt want to get involved. She won‚Äôt tell her family or the authorities ( she very anti police) 
I feel upset that she‚Äôs in the situation and guilty for not doing anything about it. 
All I can do is offer my support and ask that she get help."

"It is a fictional book, but it helped me to write things down like this. I hope other woman can see themselves in the main character, Lucy, and I hope I am not alone. Thank you! It‚Äôs an amazon kindle ebook called I‚ÄôM SELFISH: A Love Story."
"I am 52, I met my husband (54) in high school.  He was very popular and on the football team.  He raped me when we were in high school.  We went our separate ways and fast forward two years ago , we reconnected.  He is now a diabetic and disabled.  He is an only child and as far as his parents are concerned, the sun rises and sets in his asshole.  We got married a year ago, and he is an alcoholic, but gets sober about every three months.  I have tried to take into consideration that as a diabetic, his sugar level might cause him to be irrational.  He is extremely dependent and I did everything for him.  EVERYTHING!  Well i left him a month ago, due to his abuse, physical and mental, and his parents are telling me he hasn't eaten in two weeks and is gonna die if I don't come back.  All he does is drink and sleep.  I feel responsible and I don't know What the right thing to do is.  Any advice is appreciated."
Feel like shit I'm uprooting my life and child's life to and ignoring my bond with this person because they were treating me shitty. Anyone else struggle with moving?
"Today is Halloween so I‚Äôm happy to see my grandma (we do this every year) So I was asking my mom when we are going to see her, she then ignored me and said ‚Äúget your socks on‚Äù and I didn‚Äôt want to at the moment (because we still had an hour till we went.). My ‚Äúdad‚Äù I will refer to him as ‚Äúwill‚Äù came in, I knew my mom would always say something to him, so I prepared. My mom said that I was being disrespectful so she told will to ‚Äúpunch me/ kick me‚Äù. Wich he did and I fell to the ground, my moms excuse for this is ‚ÄúI didn‚Äôt know he was gonna hit you that hard‚Äù. And she then calls me dramatic. Will drags me to my room and knees my stomach and here I am now. What do I do?"

"Tonight I went on my first date since breaking up with my ex. I saw him last on July 17th when he smashed in my window and I finally had the balls to call the cops and get him arrested. He called me three days ago to ask me again if I wanted to get coffee and I declined, again. 

I had my first date tonight and it wasn‚Äôt perfect, but it was something great and the guy was amazing and so nice to me. Please realize there are good people out there and you deserve better. Don‚Äôt get stuck in that negative loop, you can break free. Just like I did. 


It was the hardest thing I‚Äôve ever had to do, but it‚Äôs worth it. There is no growth without pain, I promise it will get worse before it gets better but that‚Äôs how it has to be. 

Please take care of yourselves. 

XOXO"

Anyone else feel the same?

Is there anyone that did get police involved and regretted it?"

"Why do people get on this forum and victim shame?? I‚Äôve encountered some hateful people on here, which really surprises me."
"I feel more disconnected now then ever from other people now that I'm not with my abuser. Who will we celebrate holidays with? My infant son won't have a family like I did. I have my mom and my sister and her kids but I don't really want to be with them either. Ever since my abuser got in a fight with my sisters husband years ago I haven't really wanted to hang around them alot. I talk to my mom alot, but other than that I'm cut off. 

I don't think I can do this long term like this single parenting no friends hardly any family ties thing. I'm sick of being isolated. But I don't feel connected to anyone. I don't enjoy the company of anyone other than my abuser. 

Losing him has just made my depression worse.

I tried joining dating apps just to have guys to talk to to not feel lonely but it's not really helping. They are total strangers and not that interesting so I don't know what else to do to not feel alone."
My mom has an abusive boyfriend and he makes her his slave she does everything he tells her to do because she's afraid of getting hit there is never an argument about it .He has an app on my mom's phone where he can see everything shes doing and seeing whos shes texting and etc she cant have a life she has to be back home at a certain time he has a camera in her room and she cant even talk about other guys with out whispering because shes so scared and there so much other stuff I have no idea how to help her am severely depressed I have ran out of options told her to break up with him i cant even count I have no idea how to help her any ideas please?
"   
10am and hardly awake already being shouted at for taking too long to make tea &amp; told off for having to use the toilet at 9am....also told i'm the devil by my Christian grandmother. this is a standard day here. started screaming for a good minute i cant take this anymore. death would be better."
I'm 30 disabled and living with my family.  My mom  63 is incredibly verbally and emotionally abusive. She has told me she regrets me being born several times now.  She has said I ruined her life. She tells me I don't have a right to be upset.  She looks at me with disgust. I could go on and on.  The last thing she said to me was that I'm a waste of a life and a burden on my family. It feeds my depression and makes me feel like I don't deserve to be alive.  My counselor says I need to go to a domestic violence shelter or at least start a plan with them so they can tell me what my options are. I'm afraid though. I know that my counselor points out that it's as abusive as if my mom was hitting me. I still have a hard time accepting that it's abuse and I deserve help.  I feel like people wouldn't take me seriously and would tell me I'm being dramatic. How do I convince myself that I need help? Am I right and I'm just being dramatic? I don't want to be a burden
"I‚Äôve been having neuro issues since I left after the head trauma 3.5 years ago. They‚Äôve become increasingly worse and the vast pharmacopeia I‚Äôve been tasked with has not changed anything, even with new drugs like Rexulti. 

I experience confusion, memory loss, increased hostility and impulsiveness, suicidal ideations, auditory hallucinations, and violent nightmares unrelated to the abuse. My neurologist and psychiatrist are looking to rule out early onset dementia. 

I had my bloodwork done yesterday and I was within normal range and I have an EEG and an MRI on Friday. 

Just posting here as a sticking place for anyone else who has suffered either physiological or psychological trauma. This isn‚Äôt something I was expecting to deal with and wondered if anyone else here has experienced the same. 

Don‚Äôt ignore residual symptoms. And please vent here as needed."

"Has anyone had this happen to you too? What happened and how did it impact your life

My ex had filed a TRO against me and was granted A TRO ex parte cause he claimed he was fearful for his life, he had hit me the day before, he did it to retaliate. 

It was CLETS-TRO (Domestic Violence Prevention) 

The case was dismissed and then dissolved, I wasn't informed at all and he didn't show up. 

How will this affect my life now? I know my name is in the domestic violence database. I'm from Austin, TX and am afraid that this will come out in background checks both in and outside the US even if the case was filed in California.

I was planning to teach English in Asia or a job that required travel (like a stewardess)..

The case was dismissed April 2020"
"I‚Äôve been badly beaten, I‚Äôm pregnant still. After leaving the hospital, I will need a lyft or transportation in general.

"Looking for some advice..
I am currently in a relationship with someone who is in jail and currently serving a sentence for domestic abuse on his ex girlfriend (pushed her accidentally and she broke her arm)
I have tried to believe that he has and will change but slowly I have noticed a lot of reoccurring red flags which have started to worry me.
I am not looking for anyone to try and talk me out of this because I am aware of the risks etc but just want to know if anyone has ever seen/heard/know of a person who has genuinely changed into a better person?
Or do you believe that once someone has these tendencies they will always be present?"
My abuser is in a mental health facility rn and I miss him. I wish he didn't have a bad attitude sometimes. He's basically my best friend. He's been my best friend for 6 years. Today I'm feeling really alone without him. And my other friends phone is off. Not having a good day today.
"My last reddit posts gives a bit of background, if you are looking for more context. I know my situation is not as bad as others' as the physical violence is currently extremely minimal. Only one occurrence so far. However, I can't keep my son around this or in such an unhealthy environment. I am at my breaking point and have tried everything to ""fix"" the situation, ""fix"" my husband, and keep peace in the household. He is getting worse, and I have experienced this in my own family life where my parent slowly spiraled out of control and got increasingly more physically abusive. My question is, what advice do any of you have for going about getting a protective order? Both in general and as someone who has no income of their own, would be with a child under 6 months on their own, has no car, no family/friends, no way to pay for their apartment, etc. The only thing keeping me here is the financial aspect along with no transportation. Please help."
"Hello, so my grandmother has always suffer from domestic violence and i‚Äôm shook how none of my aunts have ever done anything. This summer i was with them and i saw my grandpa trying to hurt my grandma and thats when i realize, before i knew he hit her but now i really saw it and i realize i need to do anything!"
"Thank you in advance for your help.

I have a regular customer at work who I suspect is being abused by her husband. She is sometimes dressed in house clothes and slippers in our parking lot during the day, smoking alone and crying or talking with her daughter. One time I tried to say hi outside after my shift and she wanted to hide her distress.

My city has resources and shelters but I'm not sure I should assume anything or meddle. What are tactful and genuinely helpful things I can do in the community or with her?"

Hello everyone, this is my first post on Reddit. If this is the wrong place to post this, feel free to lmk. I‚Äôve searched high and low, to the best of my ability, to find a community on Reddit that addresses this particular subject matter and I‚Äôve had no luck thus far. 

I (33M) am currently dating someone who was in an abusive relationship. I need/want to know how to best assist her through this process so she can heal properly in time and ideally we can eventually have a successful relationship. Reddit has become a place that I can come to for all sorts of information/subject matters but this subject matter seems to have been missed.

Please lead me in the right direction, I‚Äôm sure I‚Äôm not the only person who has interest in speaking to abuse survivors about how their SO‚Äôs were able to help them, etc.
(I‚Äôve been thinking about this post for a while but figured, no better time then today to find out). I also tried to post this in the Ask Reddit community but that was unsuccessful."
I have pictures of my bruises and cuts but it's a year old. I finally need to get out and get help but the only evidence I have is from a year ago. Am I hopeless? Do I need more recent evidence to get him convicted? Please help.
"If emotional abuse happens but without physical abuse, would it be possible to detect and therefore intervene? I think it mostly falls to the category of private life, so even if you can detect that, you still can't intervene?"
I left him and moved away over 7 years ago. I had a dream last night that I was walking with my now husband in the grocery store and he came toward us and I froze. I woke up and my pillow was soaked in tears. How is he still haunting me?
"I am a year away from 18 and I've lived in a very toxic household my whole life. My father has been abusive in multiple ways to me and emotionally abusive to my mother. I don't want to leave her behind to deal with him alone, but I need to get out because my mental health is at the lowest it's been in a long time and I can hardly find motivation to get out of bed everyday. He tears me down about my weight and calls me a horrible person and daughter for stupid little mistakes and I need out desperately. The other day, my mother and I got into an argument and I told her I was leaving as soon as I'm 18 and she threatened to take me off of her medical insurance and cancel my car insurance. My question to you guys is, how do I prepare myself to be independent? I have a living arrangement planned out and I've been saving money like crazy. Any help is appreciated."
The past year has been filled with my parents fighting. My extremely jealous and racist father has made home a living hell because of verbal abuse and belittling my mother. And now she doesn‚Äôt eat and says when he leaves her she leaves this world. I just don‚Äôt know what to do. This isn‚Äôt my first post here but I just need to hear from people for advice to helping myself and my mother through this
First off this was a long time ago but still haunts  me......I needed help I was getting attacked I ran outside and my phone was dead I couldn‚Äôt call police ...the first person I saw I asked for help I said ‚ÄúI‚Äôm getting attacked please help me‚Äùand they just said ‚Äúno‚Äù and ran away from me. Now I feel guilty for involving them I guess and embarrassed. But at the same time why wouldn‚Äôt they even ask what was wrong or what they could do? I could never imagine running from someone who asks for help! It‚Äôs just embarrassing and haunts me to this day.
"I posted on here not too long ago the signs I‚Äôve noticed since breaking up with my emotionally abusive bf. I‚Äôve realized more signs and they are disturbing to me, and I want to see if anyone went through something similar. 

I always told myself that the abuse I was experiencing was never physical, but I was wrong. For the last few months things have changed and I didn‚Äôt know what to think. One of the things were that he would like to randomly ‚Äúfake wrestle‚Äù me. He would push me in the bed and wrestle with me, all in good fun. But sometimes, he would take a pillow or a blanket and hold it over my face like he was pretending to suffocate me. I would tell him to stop and that I couldn‚Äôt breathe, but he wouldn‚Äôt do it right away. 

I talked to my therapist about this and she said that it sounded like he was testing my boundaries to see how I would react. It makes me think that if I stayed in this relationship, things could‚Äôve gotten worse...."
"I don‚Äôt know anyone who has gone through what we have been through. I‚Äôve been shouldering the emotions alone for years. I have the BIGGEST support system, but it means so much more to be able to identify and empathize with people. 

I have not experienced any pity or judgment here, and I‚Äôm sure there are sage and seasoned staples here, and I just wanted to say that in the 4.5 hours I‚Äôve been here, I feel better a little bit. 

Thank you all for present and future thoughts and community. I‚Äôve never had this."
"New to Reddit: I was in a physically abusive marriage for 5 years. I‚Äôve been free for 3.5 years. I‚Äôm still as angry as I was the day I left, still as angry as my testimony, still as angry as getting my divorce after 2 years of only wanting my last name back. 

Superficially I‚Äôve ‚Äúmoved on‚Äù and I actually find myself happy about nearly every other part of my life so far. But I had a dream the other night that brought me back down. 

It‚Äôs not a violent dream, but it‚Äôs still a nightmare. I dreamed we were still together. Like it was nothing. But I woke up and have only been outraged since. 

How long did it take you to reach a point where things didn‚Äôt affect you as much? If at all. 

Sorry for wall of text."
