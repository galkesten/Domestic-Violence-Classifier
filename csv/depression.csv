"I’m just curious, do you think these 2 things are related? So for example, if someone lives in southern California or coastal Spain, where the sun is out most of the year and the weather is quite warm and pleasant, are they 'happier' than someone who lives somewhere with 4 proper seasons (including winter with clouds/some snow, etc.)? Lets just say these people (in either location) are fairly happy in their jobs/careers/lives and are paid a decent amount to enjoy a middle to upper middle class life.

Is anyone in this subreddit reading this, living in such a place with year round mostly warm, sunny weather? If so, how is this life exactly? Are you happier living in such a place? Or not. I suppose this can all be very individual. I'm just wondering if living in such an environment could make someone 'happier'.

If you Google what are the happiest countries in the world, all of these countries listed are in climates with 4 seasons and some pretty harsh winters. Interesting:

**The 10 Happiest Countries in the World:**  
**Finland. For the fourth year in a row, Finland is number one when it comes to happiness.**  
**Denmark. Denmark remained in the number two spot this year. ...**  
**Switzerland. ...**  
**Iceland. ...**  
**Netherlands. ...**  
**Norway. ...**  
**Sweden. ...**  
**Luxembourg. ...**"
"Theres about 10+ flies in my room rn. My room isn't SUPER dirty but it's dirty. I hear them flying around living in the trash that I live in. My mind is no better. My life is no better. I am not normal. Yes there is such thing as normal. I am not that. Ill be a loner and outcast, virgin,  forever. I hate how I look. I look like an ugly 12 year old (I'm 21) despite any muscle I've gained. Depression killed my sex drive so even if I were to get laid it wouldn't be enjoyable and I wouldn't be able to get hard or last long. I'm grumpy always and not happy and never will be. Professional helps been useless. kEEp tRyIng they say. False hope and condescending words is all I am given. I dislike people. I'm bitter and angry. Very stupid too depression makes you stupid. Or maybe that's just me."
"It's depressing to know that I actually feel lonely so bad. I didn't even  notice that I've been being like that before I get physical symtoms. How stupid.. How can I be so crucial to myself? 

I wanna quit eveything. I feel sick of everything."
"I'm looking for an escape from my day to day routine, I'd like to find somewhere to stay without internet and be put to work. I'm a 30 yr old video game addict and overweight, i work full time and find it hard to want to do anything besides work and play video games and sleep. I've tried quitting and I always get bored and cave in to eating or gaming. I've lost 170lbs previously and gained it all back now and lack the motivation now to do it again.  Does anyone know of something I can do or where I can go to take off work and focus on my physical and mental health?"
No it fucking doesn't. I've been hearing this my entire life and it still hasn't gotten any better. If anything life as an adult is even more depressing. How long is it going to take?
"I did the best I've ever done yesterday. I brushed my teeth, took a shower, meditated for 20 whole minutes, walked for almost an hour, made a schedule for myself, morning, nightly and weekly. I did all the things I set out to do.

But around early evening things took a turn for the worst. The nukes began dropping in my head. 

You can't stay like this, you'll never achieve anything, you're not worthy of love, you're not even worthy of being acknowledged, you are a pointless enigma, you are hopeless, you will never be anything more than a failure, you can't get it right, you will fall, you should just end this, give up, no one could ever love you, just end this, you can't escape the pain, you can't deny reality, you can't do anything, you should just end this.

Combined with the siphoning of the worth of my deeds, how pathetic my attempts were in reality, the pressure inside my head, my heart like a sack of stones. It's been present now for about 6 hours. I did manage to get myself to sleep for about 7 hours in there.

But as soon as I awoke, those thoughts were right there, the heaviness in my chest, this overwhelming sense that I just cannot escape reality. That I've lost everything and I will always be bound to lose whatever I try to build.

I try to remember my therapy tools. I try to just breathe, acknowledge how bad it hurts and just let it be. Try not to fight it. But it just keeps screaming inside that I am just an empty monster pretending to be human.

Seems my depression was more than ready to strike me down. To try to convince me of how hopeless the remainder of my life truly is. All the things I've been forced to miss, things I can't let go of. My children. How I failed them. 

All of this pain, all of the regrets, all of that loss. Just more nuclear bombs going off inside my mind. In all of it I wish I could just scream but I can't. I wish I could cry but I can't. 

The pain is so total, the destruction of my mind seemingly complete. As the fallout begins to rain down. 

I want to believe, this seperate entity from my mind, this ""me"". The fractures and fault lines seem to vast to repair. In all of it, I suppose I should at least be grateful that I have therapy in about 4 hours.

Though I'm not sure what I'm really doing beyond wasting my therapist's time. It all feels so inevitable and I try to convince myself it will pass. I try to say maybe it isn't as bad as my mind is making it out to be. I try to fight this war through kindness but I feel I am failing, just as I always have done."
"Hello, before I start, I'm not a native english speaker so I may make mistakes in my text, please don't mind.

I'm 17, and it's been a few years I'm dealing with depression. It started because of my family. I stopped talking to my dad at 10, and my mom isn't bad but she's alcoholic and maybe has mental disorders. Last year, I began my studies, and I ran away at the other side of France because I couldn't support it anymore, especially after the lockdown. It has been really, really hard to stay with my mom at home for 5 months. Indeed, school was helping me to see other people and just... Don't be depressed. I had many mental breakdowns, even at school, I had a boyfriend that almost raped me and took advantage of my situation.

But my last year was incredible. I started to talk to people. I love my new studies, and being far away of every one of my problems for 10 months helped me so much. But now there are the summer holidays, I have to stay by my mom until September. I hadn't the choice to come back or not, she had already said that she wants to kill herself a few times, I don't want her to make mistakes. It's been only a week, and I just can't do anything. I'm laying on my bed all day. I haven't even the energy to eat. It's been maybe 3 days I haven't ate anything. I'm trying to tell my friends, but I don't know how... I can keep writing and erasing messages for hours, I don't know how to tell them. I try to send them memes about depression. I don't really know if it works. I'm so afraid of just drop school next year because I'm too tired.

I want to try to talk to a doctor, but my mother always has laugh on my condition, she says I'm just playing a comedy, and I can't see a doctor without her. I really don't know what to do. I don't know what I'm expecting in publishing this here. I just can't kill myself. I have been so happy last year, it would just be a waste, and I don't want my friends being sad, but I'm praying to be killed by anything accidentally that's so ridiculous.

I'm really sorry, thanks for reading me."
"I've been really long fucking overdue for a good hard cry, but it just hasn't come. Last time I really cried hard was like maybe a year ago I think, best I can do is get slightly teary. For whatever reason my physiology is such that crying just doesn't come to me very easily. I hate it, I want that cathartic release, I want to completely embrace how fucking terrible my life is and how much I fucking hate myself."

"20(M) My phone is always in silence, I don't even know why I have one. Nobody ever reaches to me unless they want to get something out of me.
It's been like that since I can remember, people come and go, and they always take something for me. I have never been pick in gruop activities, nor the person that comes to mind when you're throwing a party or something like that. 
So I decided that if I gonna be tool the rest of my life, I'm gonna be the best at it. Want me to do your homework? Got it. Want me to buy you something? Don't worry. Use me to your heart content.
If I'm not going to be able to be happy, or even be consider a person, why bother with everything else? 
Maybe I have the wrong approch here, but I don't know what else to do. I never have been happy, I'm starting to think that it's to late for me"
Last night the my dog was poisoned... and i don't know how to deal with it. It's so unfair. He never ever hurt anyone he was a giant with the biggest and softest heart. He wasn't even 3 yet. Just typing this is making me cry my eyes out and i cant stop. Knowing he will never come home again and I'll never be able to throw him a ball again.. breaks my heart
but I don't think I'll kill myself
Im in so much fucking pain I just wish I could die my life gets more painful every day dying is more realistic than my dreams
"My dog recently died and i feel way worse than before, i know i used to hate myself, but since he died, i feel like i fell down a spiral of pain, i really feel bad, i really want to kill myself but i also dont, i hate myself"
"I’m a heavy lover. Recently got my heart broken about 6 months ago and can’t stop thinking back to the love and mistakes that were made 

Let’s not get things twisted though, the other side of the story isn’t pretty at all and I was not treated well so idk why I am feeling bad for myself or whatever 

There is this one mistake I made before we started even dating and asking her to be my GF though that has been getting to me 

We met at college and everyone had graduated now and gone separate ways but when we first hooked up, 2 of my buddies asked me if we had went all the way and I spilled the tea and said yes. But I messed up when I also revealed she had a fishy smell that I noticed and just can’t stop hating myself for it. 

I think this girl truly knows how to make guys be in a depressive state and get her way no matter what cause I couldn’t be myself and constantly judged so made me act strange. 

I have a heart and know that’s not morally correct or smart to do, but we actually were in love for 2 years and she hurt me that lead to us breaking up eventually and stuff but randomly I have thought of this time of mistake and can’t come to terms with being okay or forgetting even though nobody ever found out and we weren’t dating or in love yet"

"I feel really low lately. I'm 26 yo female, and I just feel like I'm just here on this earth without having asked to exist. Not wanting to.  
I hate myself for having certain people in my life, keeping certain people in my life, ever having some people in my life, the way I am at work, the way I am at home, my inability to guide myself through life, my hostile attitude and anger management but also my quiet anger in public. I feel like people walk all over me. I have much to be grateful for like parents who support me, dogs, nice housing because I live with my parents...which makes me hate myself that I feel so sad and empty all the time despite having all those mentioned to be grateful for. 
I can't settle on a career, I've been in school nonstop since kindergarten, and ive changed from veterinarian to PA to RN to now just wanting to quit everything. Now I have a biology degree and work in a lab while in nursing school but I'm not happy. I wouldn't say I'm doing particularly well in nursing school either nor am I enjoying the idea of being a nurse. I want to live out my life with little consequence. Give dogs a home and take care of my parents until my time comes. I'm essentially doing what I'm doing for monetary stability in order to do the above. But I lack friends, direction, and passion in my life. I guess as opposed to the average late 20s post grad. I also have this debilitating inability to let things go... past trauma, anger, sadness, bad people in my life 

TLDR; I'm lonely and lack direction in my life. I am unhappy going to school for nursing but scared to leave as I have no other goals. I'm working in a job using my first bachelors degree that I am unhappy in. I feel isolated and without friends and strongly incapable to connect with people at work or school. My parents are retiring and I want to get my shit together before they need me to support them in their old age.

Have you ever felt like this? What got you through? What would be my next steps?"
"I spend so much time alone, wishing I had friends and could go out and do things with other people, but then whenever I do actually spend time with people I always end up getting blackout drunk and acting like a complete idiot. I woke up today not really remembering what I did last night, just knowing it was bad and I was a fucking mess. I've woken up so many times with this same feeling. I'm plagued with anxiety about all the nights of my life I have sketchy memories of. How did I get home? Did I do something bad? Was something bad done to me? Why am I bleeding? Did I sprain my ankle? Was I flirting with that girl/guy? Did I try to kiss them? That sort of thing. Stupid decisions (if you can call them that...) after too much booze that I will spend the rest of my life worrying about and ruminating over. I should've learned better by now, but on the rare occasion that someone invites me to do doing something social it's always the pub, and one drink to calm my nerves about being outside in the world soon turns into one too many and me crying or falling over or trying to kiss someone I'm not even attracted to just to feel something.

The solution is surely to stop drinking, right? I wish it was that easy. I wish this drunken idiocy was my biggest problem but it's just one way of ""coping"" with the depressed, anxious, lonely existence my life has become. I hate myself. I hate everything I am and everything I've done. And I hate everyone else too, and society and the world as a whole. I've been suicidal on-and-off for over a decade. I try to convince myself to keep going but experiences like this just remind me that I'm not meant for this life and it isn't meant for me. I don't have any friends, and when people try to be my friend I either ghost them or do something to piss them off while intoxicated, because I can't soxialize sober."
"That’s the word I’d use in my situation, because well today I think I’ve really hit rock bottom, I’m not sad but I’m not happy either, I’m just, here, I don’t feel anything maybe I should but I just don’t. It’s so bizarre and crazy how just one bad thing after another can come without hesitation nor mercy and it’s fucking relentless and doesn’t give in until your at the point where you just want to fucking grab a gun and blow your brains out because you’re literally going insane by the minute. I don’t even know if I should be writing this, but I mean my therapist is fucking useless and I’ve tried everything else but not this, I guess I just want to atleast talk to people that actually KNOW what it’s like to feel like this. And then maybe I guess when something like that happens my brain will get that little false sense of hope and then I hope maybe everything might be ok again for atleast five minutes. Honestly I just can’t do this shit anymore but I gotta pretend I’m all well because I don’t want to feel like a burden to my family and friends thus why I a sad individual is just trying to hope that he can seek some help or advice I guess from his fellow sad individuals."
"We're not too well-off to afford other things, and also not poor enough to qualify for government help. My parents can barely send me to college. I badly want to die. Sometimes i blame my parents for giving birth to me when they can't support my education. We've been living like this since I was born and we never had a moment of stability. It's always like ""will we have food today? or someone will not eat breakfast again?"" I am so tired. I can't even get a scholarship because my school is not one of those ""elite"" highschools that universities acknowledges. 

I just want to die to end this continues train of sufferings. I just turned 18 and here I am working for other people that should've supported me instead. I can't even have a decent job because i didn't graduate on anything.

If I'll forever be stuck in this life, I just want to disappear..."

"Is there anyone out there? I’m tired of waking up everyday to nothing. I’m tired being ignored and feeling like I don’t matter. For fucks sake, is it too much to ask for just to feel like I matter sometimes? It doesn’t even have to be all the time, just like once a month or something. 
I don’t know, I try to not let it get to me, and I do a great job at hiding all of my feelings and keeping this act up that everything is fine and I’m perfectly ok with the fact that I don’t matter, but sometimes it gets to me. I guess that’s what’s happening right now, it’s just getting to me is all. 
I know they say love yourself and all of that bullshit, but god damn. When no one cares, it’s hard to do that. Even the people that are supposed to care no matter what, unconditionally or whatever, your family, your parents. When they don’t even care, how the fuck am I supposed to care? I’m just a product of their stupid actions, an accident. Shit they remind me all the time anyways. 
They set me up for failure, then they blame me for being a failure. I mean it is my fault im a failure, don’t get me wrong, I could just keep pretending like nothing bothers me and I have no needs or wants or anything, and just keep going, or I could just give in and stop hurting every day. I just want the pain to stop really. I wanna feel accepted to someone, 1 person. It doesn’t take much to make me happy, really, honestly I’m super easy to please, but nothing isn’t cutting it anymore."

"This song makes me sad but the feeling is a little soothing. I sleep to it and just takes the pain away. If it helps you, give it a try."
"I never really enjoyed my life, but it was manageable. My father is a royal asshole, my mother didn't intervene. My behavior was to blame according to them, it never occured to them it was a response to their shitty parenting. Of course i was bullied daily, which didn't stop for about 12 years.

In all this i was alone, and i broke 8 years ago. Major depression. I wasn't able to continue my education. I tried working, but can't deal with the pressure. The things I used to love are empty and unfullfilling. I've been to all kinds of therapy, but nothing works. By now at least i know what's wrong with me, chronic childhood trauma.

My last resort is going to a mental hospital, but if that fails i just don't know what to do anymore.

I am a 26y/o man, and I feel like i never even started living, but only ever survived."
"my girlfriend has always had some form of anxiety and depressive episodes. she hates the way she looks and refuses to leave the house due to public/ other people just give her panic attacks etc so I am also unable to see her. she also refuses to tell anyone as she sees herself as a burden, a waste of time and thinks it's embarrassing. I love her n want the best for her so I know she needs help but it's hard to get it her when she somewhat refuses. I don't know what she suffers from its clearly a form of anxiety I assume but what else does this sound like and any solutions to any of these problems are welcomed"
"i just dont want to wake up. i dont even want to sleep. nothing good is coming. im alone, im desperate , nothing feels real anymore. im already kept pushing so long just for it to fall apart over and over im so tired i dont want to keep on i just wwnt to stop but i keep moving and working and trying to talk to people and its led to this. nothing im empty but for reget and shame about who i am what i want and all i haven't done. i dont see a reason to push on , i dont have anything to look forward to, just another day where im not enough for anyone not even myself. i dont see a difference between tomarrow yesterday or the day before its all the same feeling , i want it to end. i want to be able to tell myself i did enough, i held out long enough, that its ok to just give in, but i always feel like tomorrow could be the day something changes, if i just push a bit more i can be happy. i honestly hate it. i just want to stop"
"1) I'm going through therapy and we're in the very first few appointments (since beginning of June) to the point where I'm comfortable getting even mildly upset/angry/frustrated with her with basic questions like ""When do you think you started having problems identifying emotions?""
2) I feel like I have this deadline over my head with marriage and children and happy family, and I do want a child but I don't want to bring them into my chaos and to be able to love them and nurture them fully because I didn't get that
3) My job sucks. I was in the ER recently with suicidal ideation just as a precaution like ""Well shit I better go before I do something dumb"", paper scrubs, paper plates, sitters who want to make conversation and you're just praying the psych gets to you before the dude who's throwing shit. And I told my psych what I do for a living and he's like ""I've heard, through the grapevine, that's not nursing. That's barely reaching what you could be. And from what I'm hearing, you want to be a lot more.""
4) Chronic absenteeism. Because I'm depressed. Because I don't have the will to literally live and it's a coin flip if I want to help other people!!! And my thinking is ""Well, change your environment so you're more challenged and intellectually engaged because clearly that's not happening at your current job"" and then my boss hints she's not going to recommend me if I try and apply for patient care positions within our system... Which lands me in the hole for $10,000 for an unfulfilled sign on bonus

So yeah. I've got a roof over my head. My partner is barely hanging on and letting me stay in his house ""our house""

I did go fishing by myself this past weekend, where I got all the things, I packed them into my car, I planned for partner and myself to go, but then he got sick so I just went by myself because there was no other time besides this past weekend. Oh yeah, my dad who's been estranged from me since I was 14 is coming up to visit on Friday for a full week."
"I get advice all the time. They really do not get I am just not meant to be happy though. I let them give the advice usually and say thank you because they think I am just being an annoying, pessimistic depressed ass if I reply saying that did not work or won't work for me. 

I have done A huge majority of advice people have said and I am not happy. 

Like therapy? Did it. medications? Did it. 

go outside and meet good people? Did it.

working out? did it, got fit, still depressed.

Quit my addictions like video games and porn? Did it. 

get a girlfriend? Did it. 

The list goes on and on.

I am the very definition of a lost cause. I laugh because these advices would work on the average person, probably 99 percent of the population, but for me, my brain is so utterly fucked. Which nobody will really understand unless they had it. I was cursed with this shit."
"I've wanted one for a long time, but I haven't been able to get one because of my roommate's dog, and how he never wanted one.

A few days ago, I was offered to take over a lease. I've been needing to move out of my current living arrangement, because it's toxic, and I finally have an opportunity to live on my own. This will be my first apartment living alone. I feel like being fully alone can be bad, though, so I'd love to adopt a cat that could keep me some company. I think this will be good for me."
"23(M) stuck in Life for about 5 years now. Im just at home, in front of the PC. Barely going out, even tho i try my best doing it. Gained alot of weight and unemployed. My Depression started with 16, even professional help couldnt help me.  
I see all the people around me, getting a car, getting married and such things and im just the only one stuck. I try my best, i cant do more.  
I did a trial training in a gym, it was fun, i liked it, but its financial not possible for me. I have to wait now for the woman thats responsible for me, since im unemployed and helps me through it.  
I just dont know, had to write it. i feel pathetic, i try little steps but it feels like nothing.  
Sorry for bad english, i hope the post isnt an eyesore."
"I decided to stop taking the full dose of my Effexor; I'm only taking half.  I'm on too many meds, and being more sad can have it's upsides, like losing appetite, which I feel I need.

"I thought I had a handle of it. I was creeping away from the edge for a long time but the past couple months my head space has shifted and I cannot pull myself out of it for more than a day.
I keep putting everything I’ve learnt into practice. It makes me feel a bit better for a short time and then I find myself in this thought that it’s all fake. I’m not really happy if everyday I have to convince myself of it. I’m just fake smiling, pretending everything is okay because from the outside my life does look pretty good. So why don’t I feel that? Is that how the next 30 years of my life will be? Saying to myself every morning, “smile, life is good”. When do I start believing myself? I tried throwing myself into old hobbies, seeing friends, mindfulness etc. Yet the joy is only temporary. I understand we have to have bad days to appreciate the good but the balance is far off. 
I cannot work out what truly makes me happy. How do I want to spend the rest of my life? I feel like I’m trekking through thick mud with a smile on my face hoping there’s a meadow on the other side, but the horizon gets further away with each step.
I’m just struggling to see the point in it all. I’m not happy and I have no idea why or how to change that. I’m sick of faking my happiness. 
I don’t know how to tell my family because I can’t really put what I’m feeling into words. How do you fix something you can’t even explain.

"Hey I'm 20 years old and I've failed all my classes in 2020....

Reasons why is because I was depressed, my mother unfortunately passed away this year and in 2020 I was basically seeing her dying in front of me and there was nothing that I could do. Everyone knows about quarantine, and normal classes immediately turned into online classes, I was basically stuck at home most of the year, there was family tension, I would cry at night sometimes, wake up to look after her and not attend my classes, seeing my mothers condition getting worse was traumatizing, she had liver cancer and now I don't know if I can go back to Uni because she was paying for my tuition fees. I'm so stressed out about being rejected by other public Universities if I do apply and I fell like I've let her down, I don't know what to do, I will feel even worse if I see a rejection letter."

Everyday is hell, my family don't understand the gravity of my situation maybe I should just sincerely talk to them and ask for help"
"I feel terrible. Just like rubbish. As a useless and unnecessary thing. Why did she communicate so nicely and well with me for over a year, said that she wanted to meet, said come to study in my city, so we can see each other more often. And now, when there are 3 days left before my trip to visit her, she is ghosting me. I want to die, or just not exist."

"You know the thing ""you should talk to someone"" and the reply ""no one gets it"".

I mean idk, I don't think I'm that special, a lot of people would get what I'm going through, but really no one can helo me change anything.

What they gonna do? Give me advice? I know what I should do, thanks, but talking is easy. And to be fair, I don't want to do anything. I just want to stay here and feel miserable. I don't care about myself, I don't care about becoming better, I simply couldn't feel more disgust towards my person."

"Last night I tried to overdose with a bunch of pills. I don’t know how I survived honestly because with the amount I took it was crazy. I just ended up feeling awful, dizzy, delusional and hallucinating a lot.

I have nobody left. I don’t know what to do. I probably just ruined my liver or something now."
"I take all the advice I’m given. I take my drugs on time, yet I still feel so fucking sad.

I just exist. And I’m tired. I have nothing left.

I don’t laugh. Food tastes like ash. I can’t sleep without medication.

What’s the point. 

I cut someone out of my life a week and a half ago because his inconsistency was making me anxious and now I just feel like I don’t want to exist any more. I miss him so much.

I’ve lost all my friends through being so insular. 

The GP said they couldn’t help me because they were ‘out of their depth’ with my ADHD.

I don’t know what to do. I don’t want to die but I don’t want to live either.

When is it supposed to get easier?"
"I live in a small town in iraq/Kurdistan dating isn't allowed in where I live and there isn't much to do besides soccer

So I would watch porn all day and text girls who I would never meet cause they are in different countries.

I got tired of wasting my time like this been avoiding porn for 7 days I literally had a dream last night about sex. 

And I deleted every texting app. I'm 19 so I don't wanna waste any more time 

But now I don't know what to do about self improvement

I want to be smarter in general and stop chasing/depending on others to make me happy. 

I base my self worth on how others reply to me I also wanna fix this but I don't know how

I want to be able to make friends but I don't know how

I want to find new hobbies that are meaningful but I don't know what

Right now I work as a mechanic so a new skill for me to learn I wanna learn more skills but I don't know what

But I'm upset about the things I will miss out on."
I don't feel like doing anything else. Everything sucks
"Therapy has no use, cause it is a service someone else provides for me. In the end changing things is still all up to me and I am a self-loathing piece of nothing.

I don't seem to want to get better, I just think: it's too late. You should have done that and that years ago. All day long I feel empty and like something vital has left me. That inner sense of wonder, wanting to try new things is gone. I don't want a job, I don't want a relationship, I don't want money, I just want to give up."
"Everyday is a challenge anymore.  Used to wake up ready and excited for what the day would bring.   Now it’s how will I handle today? , will I cry?  Will I breakdown to someone ?   Can I just figure out how to sleep more without drugs?"
"Everyday may depression and anxiety get worse where to the point I cant eat, sleep pr even do what i need to do, and my heart feels heavy very heavy like theirs a big burden inside my heart that makes me not to move or to lose interest in everything. 

Then my mom notice my behaviour so she ask  whats your problem, and she also say your too young to get problem or to feel depress, your not even starting to work. Then I feel like i gonna cry because i want her to hug me, to care for me, or to talk to her, but I can because of what she say, I can even say that  I feel like dying everyday."
"I dropped out shortly after turning 17. I've just turned 23 now. 

I can't believe how fast time moves, and I can barely recall anything that happened from 2015-2019. I did almost nothing in those years, probably a deep undiagnosed depression when looking back on it.

I don't feel like I've mentally or physically developed since I turned 19. It makes me sick to my stomach. I could've been in a coma for 6 years and nothing would've changed.

My only real excuse is a major surgery when I was 18 that put me out of commission until I was 19, but of course I wielded that as a shield against questions and responsibilities, and when that passed, I faked distance education from age 20 to 21. COVID served as a grand excuse for the first 6 months of last year. 

I snapped out of this ridiculous mindset in mid 2020 and earned a spot at a decent university, but now I'm now STARTING it properly at the age many people who had their mind straight at 18 FINISHED it.

I didn't stress it when I was 18, 19 or even 20, I completely palmed off life as a money game without considering the experiences I was missing, so how am I going to answer the age question with ""23"" while maintaining a straight face? What about ""24"" in 11 months? 

I feel like I've missed so much already that the actions I'm taking now are mostly meaningless. People I once knew are already having kids, getting promotions, and going through grad school, they had their fun and they've got a big circle of friends to show for it.

I'll be fucking 27 or even 28 by the time this 5 year degree is over, just thinking of how close that is to 30 makes me upset. 

Taking stock and writing this helps, even if no one reads it. I hold no hatred for anyone but myself."

"
I don’t really know where to start or what to say but I have nothing to do. I just sit and look at my phone all day. I have asked friends if they wanna hang out but no one was able to or whatever. None of my friends ever asks me if I wanna hang out I always have to ask them which doesn’t feel very good."
"I was in the shower and started to think if my life realy is as miserable as my mom says. Im 27, a single mom to an 19 month old, currently living with my parents, going through parental court. I take 100 % care of my son.
I get up at 6 in the morning, rain or shine, no matter if ive had a panic attack the night before. I tend to my son every needs, I play, I read, I take him on walks and when he goes to bed around 7/8 I go to bed too, and im asleep by 10.

Im currently on sick leave due to PTSD, I stayed home with my son till march, and now I have 6 hours all alone every day except the weekends. I just spend my days,relaxing, napping some days, cleaning and getting back up on my feet. I went through PND/PNA and PPD/PPA (pregnancy/postpartum anxiety+depression), my PTSD went to shits and my eating disorder blossomed again. So its been hard, and since I NEED to put my son first thats what ive done, and now I have the time to put myself first during the daytime. And for me its working.

I got no social life, well I talk a bit to the neighbours and parents in kindergarten, but I dont meet up with my friends. I dont date, I just focus on me and my son, and I dont feel lonely or anything just as a bit of a failure at times. Its hard being a mom on my worst days, I dont want to get up from bed but I have to, getting outside to the playground is also hard but I do it.

I feel like im putting in so much hard work, but when my mom talks down on me tells me to cut the crap and my life is miserable, im starting to think that it might be.
From I was 8 and up until now everything has been utter shit, but im contempt, im in a good place even though im struggeling. My PPD has lifted alot and I love my son so so much, and ive been waiting for the whole motherly feeling and now that its here I just want to stay in this bubble. Im working hard to be the mama my son needs, and that means I dont do much social and during the day. But its working for me.

Before I had my son I was social,I was out and about, I worked, I was doing 110 % and it made me even more sick. Now I do things at my pace, im working on showering,brushing my teeth and all that jazz, I dont want to slip up and end up in my dark hole again. Im just super confused.

Is my life seriously so miserable?"
"Im having anxiety where I dont want to talk with the other people, or cant sleep or eat then because of that my relation to the other people including my family got worse where I feel more awkward to talk to them or to meet their eyes so I always lock my self to my room whenever my aunty or cousin visit our house, because of that  I get overthinking where what if they think Im weird, or what if they start to dislike me or to hate me, since I cant even talk to them because of that damn wall inside my hide that forbid me to talk with the other people and start to make an  assumption of what my family thinks of me and that wall is my anxiety. So because of that some other people say that im too pridefull or to queit, or snobby or arrogant but they dont know that each time i interact with them i always carefull about my expression or word in that way i can hurt them, becauee my looks bratty or pridefull but that not who i am, Im just carefull of everything, I  even create a scenario of what should I say in order for them to think that Im not that kind of person 

But they cant even see on who I am,and that is the reason why i start to shut my self to the world to them people around me and start to hate my self to thenpoint that i want to die because i know to my self how loser i am."
"Maybe then I could find peace or if not God or whatever could make sure my family would be okay after it became too much for me to handle. I can’t though. I can’t believe in a God that would allow so much suffering, not just to me but the millions of others with depression, rape victims, assault victims, cancer patients, people who never find love, people who get theirs love stolen from them. I just, fuck, I don’t know and I may never know at least in this life. I say to myself a lot that the only reason I am still alive is my family but I don’t think that’s true. I’m also scared of what comes after or, I guess, what might not. This isn’t to say I don’t want to die though or that I would regret it if I did. Just, yeah, those are my thoughts."
"I have chronic asthma and allergy and I feel so sick everyday. I am just tired and I gasp for breath for even simplest of tasks. Just able to do work from home barely while getting tired and burned out. It's hard even to do simple tasks. When acute attacks trigger it feels like my life is just ripped out of my body as I struggle for oxygen. Add to that allergy to most foods means I am not able to eat most foods. To that I have a weakened digestion and suffer from pain and food poisoning if I eat something that may contain allergic ingredients. Sometimes I feel why do I exist. Every day is same,getting up dragging shitty body for work which isn't even unable to keep up with normal tasks, getting rebuked at work and coming home and repeating the same thing. I can't imagine fucking death as watching people die due to lack of oxygen is too painful to even watch. You cannot eat anything nor you can drink as you are gasping for breath.  Coupled with that depression makes the experience even better."
"I've never had a friend in my life because everyone thinks I'm weird. I'm 20 years old and in college and I haven't made a single friend. I just wish I had friends who I could hang out with and talk to, and have a good time with. In high school I had zero friends too. I just don't see the point in living."
"So I’ve been getting more and more upset that nobody seemed to wanna do anything with me. Now that they do, I find their attention kinda bothersome. 

I feel like I’m being pulled every which way and all I wanna do is sleep. 

What the fuck is wrong with me!? Why does every activity feel like a gods damned chore!?"
"i don't. i just wish that i was never born. i feel so ungrateful because i have everything. im sure that everyone struggling in this sub, would love to have my life. i have a family that loves me. many friends that care about me. no one has been bad to me, no one. i graduated as third of my class, now have a good paying job. i live with 2 of my closest friends in a beautiful house. but i feel like shit everyday. i wish no one knew me so i could just disappear. i can't leave the people that love me. i find many things to complain about. i lash out at people. i became a monster. i feel just like my brother."

"Does anyone else have situational depression? I have been homesick for years and my wife won’t allow us to mive back to our homestate where all of our family is. We have a 7 year old daughter who isn’t growing up with any family surrounding her. The homesick turned into depression so i went to a psychiatrist who diagnosed me with situational depression with no real cure for it other than to somehow move back home.

Anyone else share a similar situation?"

I'm struggling to keep going. I think it's easier talking to strangers then telling people I know how i feel. I'm in a bad place right now but I'm trying so hard to not give in. I used to be so different but that seems like a different lifetime. I still have hope things will get better but the hope dwindles every day.
"I know I'm not really fit to work mentally.

I want to quit, but only because I'm not ready, I almost just want half a year to get my mental health in check so I can.

But how can I do this? Or"

"I remember that I used to be excited about things intrinsically. I was excited about the topics I learnt in school because they were cool and because I loved discussing them with people. At that time I couldn’t answer the question “if you knew you could not fail what would you do?”. And I still can’t. But at that time I would spring from topic to topic because they were interesting. 

Now that I’ve started working full time (fully remote) I can’t find the price of me that causes me to full engage with a thing. I can’t find the so-called “flow state”. Partly I think because I’ve become disillusioned by the ends achieved by my work, and partly because I don’t know people I can share my work with in the same way I did in school and also because work ties me to a single project. 

Because I can’t access the flow state I don’t know that any part of my work (or any other side project) is truly exciting to me.

When I look to the future and think about what job I want I know that I want a job where the ends are satisfying the work is interesting and I can access the flow state. But when I make that concrete and ask should I pursue job X? Or what do I need to do to achieve Y? And I look at what I need to do to get there the motivation fades and the doubt creeps in. 

Am I really good enough to achieve that? Is that what I really want? If I put all the work in to get there will I feel as empty as I do now? 

I feel like those questions don’t arise in a person without depression."
"So all of this began like a month ago. I was in the process of getting out of a depressed situation and was finally getting better. However right as this was happening a chain of terrible misfortunes started happening to me. First I broke my finger and almost poisoned myself in the same day. I'm like whatever, shit day but it happens right? So a few days pass and I had pretty much fixed my mood from the shit day and I realized something was wrong with me (it's kinda private so I won't go in detail) but I googled it and it turns out it's a cancer syndrome. I instantly talked to a doctor but he said it I would have to wait a while for him to be available. So I spend the next 2 weeks torturing myself mentally imagining the worst case scenarios to a point where i prepared a knife to off myself if I was diagnosed with cancer. I went to the doctor a few days ago and the test results should be out tomorrow. I was once again starting to feel better and convincing myself that it's gonna be alright when just a few hours ago I fell and broke my foot. Why are all of these bad things happening to me? Why are they all happening in such a short amount of time? I'm laying on my bed in horrible pain and worrying about my foot, and tomorrow I could be diagnosed with a life threatening disease. If the test results are fine I would probably get in a car crash or something. I can't take it anymore. When I try to tell my friends about my problems they reply with ""Sucks I guess"" or something like that, my parents don't care either. I'm lonely and going thru the hardest time of my life."
"
I’m not sure what I’m doing. I don’t know why, but I'm posting something on a subreddit for other people to see my vulnerability and the guilt that I have been having for some time now. Maybe the only reason that I’m doing thi is I don’t want to burden the people around me with the problem that I’m having at the moment. Today I woke up just fine but when I went into the shower. I was just spacing out in my thoughts and then my ex pop into my head. I tried to forget it and not think a lot about it. Unfortunately I didn’t forget it when I got into my room after the shower. So I decided to listen to some music. This was the worst idea that I had. I ended up listening to a sad playlist. When I was listening to the first song in the playlist, I broke down crying just thinking about my ex. Thinking about how I ruined our friendship. How I was the cause of my own misery. How I was the one that lost at the end of the day. How I still like him after breaking up with him twice. How I try to make myself happy by going to another relationship the same year, a couple months after the break up with my first ex. I ruined it. I turned out to be a miserable one. That guilty feeling on the way I treated him during my other relationship. How I talk about suicide and depression in joking way to him. Knowing that he still cares about me. How pathetic could I be? I still feel guilty until this day. Knowing that I joke about my depression, suicide and my unhealthy eating habits to him. Knowing after the call with him that it was horrible to even say to him. How could be so cruel to him ? Why did I think that I could just forget about him and talk trash about him to make myself look better? In the end I was alone, had a friend group and he was in it. I got out of the friend's place since I thought If i was there, I would make it awkward for him. So I left the friend group but that wasn’t the only reason why I left the group. Just thinking about this again makes me want to do something. A little death of me. Me not being here. Me being nonexistent. Maybe that would make everyone happy If I wasn’t here. Just thinking about it now, I don’t understand why he liked a person like me? Why was it me ? It could be anyone else in that goddamn school but he chose me to like. I don’t understand why he chose me ? Choosing me was a mistake. Choosing me led me to replace you, to try to make you jealous, to make myself better like changing my body and not eating well after the second breakup. Choosing me led you to worry about my unhealthy eating habits. It doesn’t help that when I see you, I try to make myself happy or just forget about you. But deep inside me is just guilty of the way I treated you. That I wasn’t the girl that you thought I was. How the last time I hugged you and you hugged me back on your birthday last year, was actually the last moment of us being together. The last moment that ruined. After the second breakup, I got into a deep depression. I stopped eating, I started to workout to make myself look better. It just ended in tears and realizing that I really did love you. How ridiculous did I look by giving him a birthday gift that had a love letter with it to express my feelings ? How in the end all you said you felt pressure to be with me? How pathetic that I had thought of us being together again ? How pathetic that I missed you after I lost feelings for you ? How I mess up by going to him the second time we are together ? How I shouldn’t have gone back to him ? I shouldn’t have done that. Knowing that now I’m still thinking about him and how I ruin it. And how the idea of me not being here at this very moment is the best option for me."
"so in april I started a new job for the 1st time in years, its a good job and I was good at it. I was doing so well i stopped taking my meds because i didn't think they worked anyway and I don't like being on them. then i started burning out. no matter how much I rest i never feel any better. 
I'm trying to get a sicknote but the dr wouldn't see me, I've been off for a while so there's a very real possibility i might lose my job. this has messed up every good thing I've had in the past. jobs, relationships, education, have all been fucked up at some point because of my head. I feel like I just don't belong in this world no matter how hard i try"
"Everytime my mom/dad tells me to study, I suddenly feel... Empty, I feel like suffocating, like I want to cry because how my life is going nowhere but can't, I don't feel anything... Unless im watching a movie or playing video games... Is there something wrong with me?"
So just to let you know where my head is at these days I’ll tell you about myself. I’m 23M. My childhood was physically and emotionally abusive and I was neglected for a long time. The older I get I can see how this stuff has messed with me and how it’s always been messing with me and the way I socialize with people. I met my dad when I was 18 and he knew how my mom was but he didn’t want anything to do with me and my sister but he raised our half sister and gave her a great life. I never wanted to have kids and I was with this girl for 3 years and she begged me not to wear a condom said and that she was on birth control and I believed her and now she’s pregnant and I’m almost certain that it’s my daughter. She was born in April I think. I don’t know her name or where she is. My ex just went crazy when she found out she was pregnant and she got back with her ex and she won’t communicate with me at all. So that’s what’s been going on in my life. Then I met this girl and started talking to her and she seemed to really like me and I really liked her a lot too. But all my anxiety and stuff was messing with me. When someone says something good to me I can’t believe it’s true for some reason and I feel like things are going to get real bad. This girl is becoming a counselor and she just seemed like the girl that came right out of my dreams. We were going out and having a real good time and then I didn’t hear from her one day and I got real nervous and had an anxiety attack. I feel so stupid for getting like that and getting attached but I was real nervous and didn’t want to wait around for her to open my snap so I text her and told her how I felt and that I hope she wasn’t ignoring me and that she can just tell me anything. She text back and was sorry but I said a lot of stupid stuff for it being that early to talk to someone. This went on for another three weeks just being like warm and not like it was before when she was sending hearts and saying good morning sweetheart and saying she loved this and that about me. So these past three weeks just killed me because she said she still wanted to get together and that everything was okay. Anyways I feel like that was too overwhelming for me and I told her how I felt and she started talking and said she was afraid it wouldn’t work out because we live like two hours away and she really wanted to be with means that she knew I was attached and she was too but she was afraid it wouldn’t work out and that she couldn’t be what I wanted right now. I feel so stupid and I feel like I ruined things. I think I’ve jus got so much going on these days it’s already hard for me to function as it is and I was so happy to be talking to this girl it just sucks and I hate myself.
please talk about anything. Just anything. Tell me about your day or how you've been doing lately.
"I hate myself so much.

I keep trying things... I keep trying to meet people but I just can't find anyone I have anything in common with.

&amp;#x200B;

The answer, the proper human answer, is to change myself to fit everyone else. I can't do that. I just can't lie to myself. Maybe it's because I'm autistic.

I'm 30 years old and no one has ever seen me sexually. I feel like everyone I've known would laugh at the idea or anyone ever being in love with me. I've... also never met anyone I've been attracted to. But like. I mean, yeah, I have ""high standards"", but if I myself live up my standards, why is it wrong for me to want to spend time with someone else who works as hard as I do towards the same standards/values?

&amp;#x200B;

But I feel like no one will ever accept me because I'm a virgin. Because I care about sex-positivity and LGBTetc things and things like that (I'm pansexual), but I feel like I wouldn't be seen as legitimate, that I'd just be laughed out of the room and trashed because I've never actually been with anyone.

&amp;#x200B;

Just... having no friends is the same as missing an essential nutrient. You just can't function. No amount of pushing yourself to get over it is going to make up for that. 

&amp;#x200B;

And I'm at my limit.

&amp;#x200B;

I just want to be seen. I just want to be acknowledged as a person. I want to exist. I want to actually exist. I feel like I don't exist because no one notices me. 

&amp;#x200B;

Just... being 100% ignored... it hurts. I just need friends.

&amp;#x200B;

If I died today, no one would even know. Like. There literally isn't a single person anywhere who would miss me."
"Hi everyone. Hope everyone is having a good day. 

During 2020, I was officially diagnosed with depression. I have always had symptoms of depression and most likely should have been medicated long beforehand, but during quarantine my symptoms skyrocketed and I needed to get help. 

I began seeing a therapist, she diagnosed me and recommended zoloft as my treatment and for several months so far so good. 

But as of June my symptoms have gotten worse then what originally caused me to seek help. I’m almost constantly sad and suicide is a frequent thought in my mind. I am not actively planning but there are times where I will have a thought to just do it then. 

And now, as of last week, I have almost no energy, no real drive to do almost anything and I have no interest in almost anything. All I do is sleep, work and eat. That’s it and just thinking about it makes me extremely depressed.

Yesterday I called out of work telling them I wasn’t feeling well and I just needed the day. I slept for almost 14 hours last night and I woke up with no energy and I was nauseous. I went in to work today and my manager quickly sent me home because of my symptoms and he thinks it’s COVID but I haven’t gotten the courage to tell him I have depression because him and the rest of my work aren’t exactly the most progressive when I comes to mental health. 

On the car ride home I made the realization that I’ve gotten to the point that my depression has directly effected my life and now I feel worse then I have yet. 

I’m not asking for help. If anything this is just me venting. But today really sucked."

"Why do I always want to delete all my social media accounts and go MIA. We’re all getting older, I know I can’t expect to act the way I want them to act but I feel like everything I do is wrong and they’ll just shade me in someway after we hang out. I always over analyze my friends behaviours, the way they act around me and I start to overthink that everyone hates me. I don’t know if it’s the weed putting words in my head but I do think i’m somewhat weird or crazy. I connect to strangers way more than friends, after knowing a person for a while, I hate them lol but it is a temporary feelings. I can’t seem to be with people, i’ve been to myself for so long now especially during the pandemic that made me even crazier got me thinking when could I ever be normal.

I should definitely stop smoking weed because it brings my “alter ego” that I don’t want to be, I just want to feel loved and not judged."
"I (24M) am going through one of my worst depression phases right now. (Also struggling with anxiety and unusual OCD which makes things much harder)

The story:
Been through tough times since childhood.
Had a really bad year.
Started meds.
Got better.
Was in a relationship.
Didn't go that well but things advanced fast.
Got cheated on.
Now feeling emptiness and depression like never before.
Therapy of once a week is expensive but still not enough as in between I feel really bad.
Meds are not doing much anymore.
I still have to work and pretend to be in control of myself.
I also want to cry all the time but can't cause it seems I lost my ability to cry.

I feel miserable, depressed, exhausted, destroyed and really don't know how to get through all this. I feel like I can't be okay on my own anymore.

Simply: Too tired...

Any advice or thoughts?



Also would love to talk more and exchange stories. Preferably females as they might better understand some specific things that happened and share their different perspective."
They saw the scars on my arm when checking my blood pressure. I blamed it on my cat because they have scratched me on accident before but I’m scared that the doctor didn’t believe me. This sucks.

"...but only when you get it.

It's becoming more and more frustrating with _anything_ that I do there's always something negative people need to interject with. Never constructive. It's to the point where even small things are bothering me and that's becoming an issue. The biggest thing that gets me are these attitudes of X does it better so you're invalid or Y has it worse so you're invalid. It really makes you feel small and like a nobody.

Time and time again I'll try something again and it just ends up in the same place. Nobody genuinely cares, which is why I rarely bother anymore to reach out and express things. I'm in this alone and just need to deal with it I suppose. When there's nobody to advocate for you, you just need to do it yourself. It's very hard to pick yourself up when you're in a tough spot.

Am I letting the negative win? For now yes and I hate that. I really wish things could be different sometimes. Living a happier life will come in time I hope. 

Thanks for stopping by whoever you may be out there-"
"My family has been toxic to me for quite a few months now, I can't handle the hate and their hatred glance at me everytime they talk to me. It's not just their speech, it's their body language which pushes me back everytime.
I'm sharing this just because, I want to let it out.
This incident is when I was in 6th standard, like every other kid I wanted attention and quality time with friends and family.
At about 8pm I asked my mom if she wanna see a movie together, she denied so I started requesting her and maybe got my tears out because I was not feeling good either at school or at home.
This somewhat made my father decide to pull me from the back of my shirt and glide me through the back of the house getting scribbled on the ground, I was crying there was nothing else I could do.
My mom stood behind and saw what happened to me, he took me to the back of the house and thrashed me on the ground, the back street.
People usually spill alot of broken glasses on the back house  to prevent theft, so they all got inserted on my back and I still have the deep scars which didn't get fill up yet.
They both went inside leaving me there and my sister came to me crying.
I was in so much pain that I couldn't move.
Yea that's it, now when me and my sister have an arguement, she taunts me about how she should've never came to see me."
"I’m in lockdown at the moment, with a lot of people not giving a shit. We’ve been in lockdown for 5 weeks so far, with no end date in sight. I’m missing my parents and my friends so so much. I can feel myself spiralling further. I’m still taking my meds, and normally they work. I’ve been stable for a while now, only experiencing mild episodes. 

Since maybe the third week of lockdown I started getting worse. I’ve relapsed into self harm for the first time in years. My suicidal thoughts are getting really difficult to ignore. I haven’t slept more than 3 hours a night for at least a fortnight now. 

It sounds stupid, but I’ve started vaping to help with my urges. Knowing that it’s bad for me makes me keep doing it. I’m going to try and quit once lockdown is over, but I don’t even know when that will be. It sounds really stupid, but knowing the harm it’s causing me just helps. At least a little. My partner took away my artist scalpels, because I’d been using those. But then I found a lighter and just used that instead. I just struggle to care. I feel so empty."

I have one younger sibling and even as a 21 year old I am still jealous of her. I have always worked hard to get where I need to be and I have been through so much abuse weather in sports or school. She has gone through no adversity and never has to work hard to get anything. Things just fall in her lap while I constantly grind to get any scrap. I get so upset sometimes and wonder why people treat me so awfully and she gets treated so well for doing nothing and isn’t even nice to people.
"There are several times throughout the day where my depression/mood gets so bad it physically hurts being alive. I just wanted to know if anyone else feels the same. I also can’t concentrate during these moments and can no longer really enjoy anything. My friends and family know about this, but even with all the support I’m fortunate to have, I feel like I’m screwed and my brain is breaking down."
"Somehow I managed to not think about my depression for nearly 3 years, I can hardly believe it. I'm posting just so I can feel that I've talked to someone. Something happened a few days ago, my girlfriend basically treated me like I was a child, it's the first time that's happened and I didn't let it slide, I got upset and even apologized for getting upset later, she never apologized back.

I guess what was keeping everything back was pretty fragile because just a couple days stuck in my head has brought me all the way back to my emotional health when I was 17, I really don't know what to do, maybe letting the feelings pass will be good enough, but I think I just needed someone to talk to, or at least to pretend. Thank you to anyone who read this"
"After the pandemic started my mother and my sister’s addiction issues went out of control. My (F21) own anxiety and depression got so horrible, and trying to be there for my family was exhausting. I was put on academic probation for a summer 2020 course that I failed and then fall and spring I failed a few more classes (all online). I got kicked out of school but everyone told me it would be okay because I could appeal and get back in for fall. I just received word today that the university committee felt that I needed to focus on my mental health more so they denied my appeal and I won’t be allowed to apply to the university for at least a year. I worked so hard on my appeal and started going to therapy so that I could get back in school but now I just feel worthless and hopeless, like some unusable product of my family’s trauma. I’m having such horrible thoughts about myself and what I want to do to myself. I know I can go to community college but my parents will be so disappointed in me when they find out. I’m not looking forward to just working minimum wage jobs the rest of my life. I got fat during the pandemic and I just want to give up on getting healthy again, I want to give up on everything now."
"I'm unemployed for several months and was working in a fairly huge company had people who respected me and had a huge name in my company and good amounts of contacts and then I got a new manager who was very hard to deal with that person literally changed every person who I was connected with first they all started ignoring me(even people who I helped gettjng salaries raised,helped them with their work taught them different things) and I couldn't bear any of that so I went to my superior with request to change dept because of this manager's behaviour but this guy told me ""work if you wanna work or get out"" then I adjusted with these people for months then all of a sudden I got a call from HR saying you have complain against you from your manager which was so false and it was clearly framed against me (my manager went ahead and manipulated my previous works to prove their point) I was blamed for things that I did not even do then I brought my evidence and proved it all wrong and then later that month I get another call from HR saying come and sign your resignation your contract is terminated as you have done a huge fraud with the company I was shocked I was so loyal to the company and worked so hard but I just got shit upon by a c**t who came in just recently well there was no investigation what so ever and even my people who worked under me and my coworkers pretty much all of them cut their ties with me and no one responded to any of my msgs they read all of them but no one replied now fast forward I applied to many companies and worst part is it's the pandemic now and finding work is very hard and what really makes me feel like ending it all is that I applied to different jobs in my working industry gave interviews and got very good responses I was expecting offer letters from them but to my surprise I found out that each and every place I applied to some person had a connection to my old company and the people who framed me .Therefore I am not being hired anywhere since my name got destroyed in my old company and pretty much none of my ""so called contacts"" have even replied to my msgs and some even blocked me 


At this point I feel like my careers destroyed every day feels like a standstill and I feel like ending it all but I just think of my family and how hurt they will be and tbh I'm afraid of doing it, I guess every human is but yeah its nuts how life can change in a blink of an eye and I do know some people have it far worse than me but man this sucks and anyone who has read my msg this far thank you it means alot because I have no one to cry to or discuss with I'm all alone and helpless but idk how can some people be so cruel that they would want to destroy other peoples career sometimes I feel that I was the mistake for even being born in this world but ah man ffs I'm done ranting 
Well I hope no one goes through what I did"
"I’ve been working hard for the last year to better understand my anxiety and depression, to try and gain control, and recognize my warning signs. I have 1-2 major suicidal idealization crises a month that are getting progressively worse and that I’m trying to control. I’m medicated and do talk therapy. I feel that deep gloom building inside me this morning. I’ve felt the build for a couple days but now I feel like the dark seed of a manic breakdown is set. Stress makes it worse but it’s there now. I don’t feel comfortable reaching out to my counselor and I’d prefer not to burden a friend with all this. Does anyone have suggestions of how to relieve it. I don’t know what to do or try and remedy this. Doing the things like have a cup of tea or go for a walk don’t usually work."
"I hate it, I hate this. I really fucking do. It's so pointless. There's so many things to change but so little money I have. I fucking hate this country, I want to move out. They made being homeless fucking illegal so it doesn't ruin the picture perfect portrait we apparently have. But then a one bedroom condo is over a million dollars. A regular apartment flat with no special amenities whatsoever (basically the basic basic house) is easily over half a million. You need to be married if not you can't own a house until you're fucking 35. And also they made gay marriage illegal lol



I hate my face and body. I also have a clothes shopping addiction. How am I ever gonna save a 5-figure to get plastic surgery. I also wanna ride a motorbike, costs money. Moving out, costs money.


I'm also still a student so I have to live in a way I fucking detest for at least another year. I'm already 20, I wasted a quarter of my life and I wouldn't be surprised if all of it is wasted and it's why I just wanna kill myself. I don't think I'll even have enough money to get all the things I want and need."
