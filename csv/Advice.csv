"Hi! I am curious with the question posted in the title. I am 18F who is in a relationship. Sometimes, I feel so restrained and feel that I'm being locked up. My partner and I fight whenever I hangout with my friends (take note that it is not really a jealousy issue or whatsoever). It just feels that I can't have a life outside our relationship. 

Whenever I'll tell him that my friends and I will hangout, he'll just get upset over it, which leads to us fighting. I just don't know what to feel anymore. Is he toxic? or I just fail to provide his wants (i.e. quality time and attention)? I know to myself that I do give him these as I make sure that I have time with him everyday even if it is just an hour or two. But, I just don't know anymore if it is my fault or his. Should I be the one to adjust? Or him?

Take note that I allow him to do his stuff and I don't get mad or whatsoever. But whenever I am the one who will hangout with friends, he'll get so upset over it. 

Please I need advices. I feel that I'm going nuts with this."
"So, I am the youngest in my immediate family. The oldest is my cousin who recently got married through a matrimonial site. But the thing is, while my uncle was making that site she was probably aware of it. 
My father today asked me to make one, as the second oldest sibling, who is my sister, just turned 27. I live in a traditional Indian family, so 25 above is the age where women are pressured about marriage. 
Last year my sister had a meltdown over the marriage conversation and so my father understood, or pretended to, and had stalled everything since then, but today he comes over to me, asks me to keep everything confidential and make her profile. It took my uncle 3 years to find my brother in law, so I understand that my sister was being a bit irrational before since it is going to take a lot of time to find anybody, but I firmly believe she should know about this. I tried to explain my parents the whole thing, that she should know what is going in HER PROFILE atleast, but they didn't want to listen and they started being melodramatic. Sort of the typical Indian parent thing if you ask me. They said they would let her know when they start finding suitable matches. (She will not be wedded without her and us knowing the guy, I assure you. She can very well reject if she doesn't like him, its just the profile thing) What do I do? Should I make the profile? I am a good secret keeper but a terrible liar. This feels like lying. 
About my sister's relationship status, in the beginning she seemed committed to this guy, but he was definitely not serious about her. I have talked to him casually on my sister's request (she is the type of person who sort of remains stuck on this one guy and tries to get him friendly with me.) and I didn't really like him? Throughout the last year, even though I didn't want to intrude, I couldn't help but see how she would cry every few months. It is/was (I don't know) a VERY on and off relationship. I don't even think she knows where this is going. Last year she told him that our parents and uncle are serious about the marriage thing but even then nothing happened. So I truly think she should move on from this guy. She gets really stuck in relationships no matter how undeserving the other person is. 
I could give her a warning, she would pretend she doesn't know about the profile, but if a fight occurs this might probably will get mentioned and then my parents will be very disappointed with me. 
Don't know what to do. Please help."
"I have been doing NoFap for exactly 25 days now and while I feel some small benefits such as confidence and more energy, it may just be a placebo effect. Im just wondering if there is any real point of not masturbating if you werent addicted to it at all beforehand"
"I read an article today about love bombers, and some of the signs they say to look out for remind me of me . I’m scared that I might be that kind of person. I’m also the type of person to get scared that I’m a narcissist and think about myself too much , always have a paranoia that I might not care about people. It’s such a dumb fear to have. Anyways, I really don’t think I’m a narcissist, I’m pretty sure that I am just not good with handling emotions , how can I tell if I love bombed this girl or not? I’m still dating her and I don’t want to be manipulating her"
"I worry that I may have witnessed a glitch in the simulation system (if in case we are living in one) by seeing a man vanishing.

There is a logical explanation behind it but I cant confirm it. The man probably did not vanish but I cant confirm it.

I took some pictures of tha area to discuss it with my friends and I started worrying that by taking photos I may have angered Gods of the simulation system.

Now, I worry. Should I have just minded my own business? I worry that by talking about this or taking pictures, I may have angered the Gods.

I think I saw the man through a non-glass window building and when I passed the building I saw the spot without the man being there. I rushed to the spot and check all sides i think. Noone was there. Probably, the man that I saw through the non-glass window was some meters further than the spot that I thought that I saw him. So, he probably turned to a different way while I was focusing on the wrong spot."
"So I need a some advice, I've been working in my career for a few years in Australia, have a diploma in my field and a few other qualifications but think I should soon consider going to uni as I have basically peaked as far as I can go without it (I'm 24) two of my uncles (one from both sides of my family)  who work in very similar roles. One teachers at uni (Course Dean/Department Head/ whatever they call it) he is fairly well renowned in this field. Im pretty good at my job.I never meant to follow either of them but ended up falling in from my previous job.

 We don't share the same last name nor look alike etc and haven't ever said I am related to either as I don't want to be that person.

The uni course he runs is known to be one of the best in Australia for its field and he (my uncle) pioneered a fair bit of it.  The uni would be convenient. Now I would never ask for him to do anything/ help me get in or give better grades etc nor do I believe he would even if I asked. But still worried of unconscious bias/ being questioned by peers or the quiet whispers etc if it was found out / or him knowing if I fail etc.

Should I or shouldn't I apply for this uni?

TLDR:
Uncle runs uni course I want to do. Fell into this field as well unintentionally. Uni course he runs known to be brilliant. Don't want anything untoward to happen or to be rummored. Choose that uni or another?"
"I should say this friend is two months from 18. The age is not an issue with me because they have been close their entire lives. This friend is a transgender boy. Last week a third friend had a party with friends, it was going to be my younger teen daughter's first sleepover away from home. But the boy was going to be there.  I told my daughter, ""Your friend is a boy. No exceptions, no sleepovers if a boy (or her lesbian friend) will be there."" 

My daughter is not the one who is mad, we agreed on her coming home instead of staying the night and getting ice cream instead. This boy's parents are mad. They are co parenting with different views, so this is possibly a three-way problem. One found out and is mad because I am segregating and excluding an LGBT, isolating my daughter, and all these other factors leading to them trying to cause social problems and legal matters. Many other people are mad at me right now because of it, which I don't care about but I do care if I am being unfair. The other parent is mad because by having allowed my daughter to be friends with this kid, bringing her to a party with this kid plus letting her bring this kid a gender oriented present (which I had no place in choosing, only paid for it), I am horrible. I am hurting my daughter and other kids. I'm ""enabling an adult who thinks they know everything or wants to act on perverted whim"" and other parent claims that the kid is suffering from a few mental illness that I won't name including personality, and I am enabling/exploiting these and interfering. I am not certain if this is home diagnosis, armchair diagnosis, or professional diagnosis. I can't really get that far into it and I also rely on my socially uneducated simple brain---so I want to know whether I'm right in jury for following my rules, or if I am hurting this kid/enabling others to be in danger. Also I do feel badly for even thinking about this, treating it like an issue. Am I being phobic and exclusive?

I don't have family to ask. I live under a rock and come in peace until needed otherwise. Am I in the wrong and what do I do?"
"I met this girl 6 months ago.....

She and me hit it off amazingly well.
Everything was perfect 
Same background 
Same way of thinking
Most of the things aligned 
Everything was amazing 

There were some problems such as I am a very soft sensitive person and it’s hard for me to open up and I care more about not hurting anyone and hurting myself in a way....

She is more dominant and wants me to open up more and she is a strong personality. She even brought up strong beliefs about religion and things that mattered a lot to her and were important to her.

To me those things were not as important so I respected those things.

As time moved on there were many times that she and me had small arguments but they were not make it or break it.... also I acknowledged that she has weaknesses as much as me and our strengths can compliment each other and make us stronger.

Some days I used to thank her and always be grateful to her that I met her and ..... she is not very expressive so I would get a “you too”. Even on those things I was like that’s alright that’s who she is....

Fast forward to 6 months.... she and me got engaged and it was very amazing and everything was perfect.... at the engagement she said that she wants everything to be perfect and I said to her that just her being there has made everything perfect.

....... a few days ago.......

I don’t know where the convo went but she for some weird reason assumed that I’m ...... (can you believe it) ...... she actually thought and considered that I am gay......

This completely shattered me..... and like I have no words and I am heart broken..... after all those 6 months of me telling her that she is perfect, I would love her to be my wife, even hinting to her that I would love to make love to her in bed....

She proceeded to inform her parents and they called my parents so that they could confirm...... 

I don’t know what to say or how I feel 

I feel like this has gone beyond trust. 

If she can’t even trust me on my own words.... then this would mean there was no trust to begin with? 

I don’t know what to do....

And now the worst part is.... I feel like my heart is fully broken that no matter what she will say I won’t be able to talk to her normally ever again because I will say something else that will ruin or make this relationship more toxic 

Any help is appreciated"

"I have been preparing to go to law school for the past couple of years. As I’m preparing to take the admissions exam for the second time, I’m really questioning whether or not I want to go. I go back and forth with my desire to go to law school.  I got my undergraduate degree in the healthcare field and I am thinking that I would like to try going back to that. I am also in a job that may not require a graduate degree that has the potential to be lucrative and I am being taught by some knowledgeable people. I am feeling unsure between my choices. 

I am considering waiting on everything and just continuing to work because I am pretty young and one year out of undergrad. But on the other hand- I don’t want to wait too long for anything. 

Any thoughts on waiting? Should I just pick something and stick with it?"
"I [M20] grew up in a Pakistani-religious household and struggled a lot with making decisions. My parents were very religious, very controlling and demanding. I struggled with emotions. 

Having a girlfriend was a big no no. I had a girlfriend and the entire time I felt a lot of guilt. I didn’t tell my parents. Kissing on TV was met with so much yelling. I could never watch High School Musical lol. My uncle had a girlfriend and my grandparents were very strict with us. They didn’t want us following in his footsteps.

I’m not sure how to be my own person now that I’m 20 years old and a guy. I was met with so much scrutiny and so much angry yelling when I did things wrong that it scared me. I don’t want to get yelled at. This is the age for me to meet people but it’s like I’m scared. I’m very scared that I’ll upset my parents. But I want to be my own person. 

I feel like I’m being treated like I’m better than others or something. I don’t like it one bit.

My question is to those who grew up in a religious household. Mormans, Catholic, Jewish , Muslim and etc. how did you guys manage to escape mentally and live your own life? How did you guys make that jump to a relationship? And friendship?"
"At 18, I finally took an interest in women and hoped to be a ""ladies man"". Though sex feels good, i wanted to make the women I'd be with feel good. The body confidence that comes with being a desirable man.

I developed some ""kinks"". Nothing like ""car battery on my balls"" territory, but some unconventional stuff.

But flash forward to now: I'm soon to turn 24 and have never had a girlfriend. Too shy to approach women and nowhere near confident enough. I try to lose weight, but my weight usually fluctuates.

If there's any upside to this, it's that I feel I matured more and avoided embarrassing myself if I had sex earlier in life with misconceptions such as thinking porn was an accurate representation of sex or being insecure about my penis size or not treating women right, etc.

Maybe my expectations are too high? I've only ever asked out 3 girls and all rejected me. Where as I have had girls like me and I just haven't felt the same...

In short: I wanted to have lots sex and (I really mean it) make women feel good. I wouldn't enjoy sex if they weren't satisfied. But here I am: a virgin at 24. I don't think being a virgin makes you less of a person, I just want to live out my dream goals so to speak."

"Recently my girlfriend (19) went through my phone and found a photo of me (17) putting my arm around a female friend. She went through my phone and laptop when I was passed out. And she got insanely mad. I was mad at the fact that she went through my phone as she didn’t trust me.

She assured me she had nothing to hide and that I could go through her phone anytime. I did the same to her yesterday I found pictures and videos that she sent to her ex’s. She kept all of the chats with them. One video I saw was her getting fucked by another guy. I know she loves me so much and I love her so much as well. I’m trying my best to ignore and forget whatever I saw as it all happened in the past and I know she’s loyal. I can’t forget whatever I saw I don’t even know why I can’t. She’s a lovely girl I love her so much but sometimes the video just pops into my head and I start acting cold towards her. What should I do? I don’t want to hurt her by acting this way."

"So you know how school computers have that thing where they reset every night and delete everything except for some programs and applications? Yeah, so how do you set a file so it doesn't get deleted?"
"I’m 37 and have just found out that I am pregnant (approx 5 weeks). I am currently overseas and am due to fly back to my home country next week (where I have healthcare etc). My initial plan was to wait until I get home to find a doctor/get scans etc as it’s not easy for me to do here and would cost a fortune! 

Years ago, I was told by my gynaecologist that I am at a slight increased risk of ectopic pregnancy (apparently my uterus twists the wrong way?). 

Since finding out that I am pregnant I have had slight bleeding (light but everyday) and a slight pain in my lower right abdomen ... I’m therefore a bit worried about flying without knowing for sure. 

Does anyone have any advice? Should I go and get an ultrasound (or whatever is needed) before I fly or is it safe enough for me to go home and then do all the usual tests next week? 

The flight would be around 7 hours"
"I generally try to be a fairly happy, or at least relaxed person - and it works. 

Despite that, for one reason or another, different things upset me on Reddit. Except instead of stepping-away like a proper person, I end-up doubling-down - taking out my anger on innocent Redditors to fuel the flames, eventually causing my anger to spill into destructive tendencies in real life. 

What can I do to deter this urge to lash-out and poor management of emotion?"
"So I've been in online school since 9th grade and now I'm a senior, I don't have enough credits to graduate because my teachers never helped, I never had any motivation, I struggle with really bad anxiety and depression, and I was being pushed to focus on chores around the house and make dinner by my dad instead of school work, and now that all my friends are graduating next month and im not it's really starting to affect my mental health. 
I've decided I want to work on getting my GED before this year ends but I don't know how to talk to my dad about it. My dad was an immigrant moved to America and never got a high-school diploma and my mom told me he himself has been looking into getting his own GED as well. I don't know how to approach him about it because he wanted me to graduate and I feel like such a disappointment for basically flunking out of high-school. I have no clue if he would be open to us both working towards to getting our GED together but I'm so scared for all of this. 
My dad always asks when is graduation and what work I'm doing for the day in school and I'm starting to get bad anxiety whenever he comes home now in fear he's going to ask about it again.
I have no clue on how to approach him and thought maybe coming here to ask for advice would be the best idea
Thank you if you read all of this btw"
In Australia.
"I registered at a local community College, and did literally every step but enrolling in classes. Actually, it was after meeting with a councelor that I realized I don't like any fields of study, and I don't feel like I have a valid reason to go. 

From what I've read, the people who feel that college is ""worth it"" are the ones that go for specific, high paying degrees. And committing to a career that I'm not really interested in just seems like the wrong answer. 

I already told my whole family I was going. If I don't, they probably won't be mad, but just as unsure about my future as I am. I just don't know how I'm supposed to carry on long term. There's no job I can see myself in, be it 5 years from now or 20."
"My daughter is younger teens.She wears skirts and dresses all the time. If it matters most of them are the flare skirts are the waist or layered ones, what ever they are called. She is usually fair in judgement, she is not comfortable in anything above her mid thigh. But now the industry fashion and online shopping paired with me giving her more freedom makes it tough. She looks at so many clothes and I know by the time school comes, I'm going to have to tell her some of it is too short. This also makes gift shopping difficult. I have to blame my unfair dad eyes because everything over an inch above the knee, I get nervous about, and it seems like things are getting shorter. I'm trying to settle on the shortest being where fingertips touch the thigh because that is the length of her favorite shorts but I'm not seeing that happen.

What length above the knee do you find appropriate? Even skirts with shorts in them."
"[  “Psychiatric” Munchausen's syndrome by proxy refers to the presentation by the mother or the caretaker of signs and symptoms suggestive of a psychiatric disorder in the child - for example, Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD), autism, ect   ]

I'll type a summary of my life story and you can tell me if this is normal or not because I honestly have no idea.

At the ages four to seven, I saw my mother being abused by my step-dad. My family were aware of what I had seen but chose to ignore my trauma and shove high functioning autism down my throat. Since I grew up in an aggressive environment, I copied the actions of my step-dad -- I threatened to k!ll people, stab people, played up a lot, ect. Trauma can mimic the signs of autism.


Growing up, I was told 'you're a loner', 'you don't think normally like everyone else', 'you don't see the world how everybody else does', ect. When I was told those things, I was around seven years old. Even if I were autistic, I doubt that's the way they should've handled it.


Since my mental health was ignored and mental health professionals were showing up at my school without warning, I struggled to go school. In Year 6, I had 40% attendance. I only managed to go to secondary school for a few weeks before I stopped.


I spent the next three years out of school.


During that time, I got a diagnosis of autism and depression. Looking at the three documents I have managed to get a hold of, it's a bunch of trash.


One of them seems to be checking me for psychosis or maybe a delusional disorder? Not too sure, but it says there was no evidence of distress but there was evidence of anxiety, I denied any abnormal perceptions, no paranoia or su!cidal ideations. I denied experiencing any thoughts to harm myself or others. My Nan was the one to explain the entire situation and were keen for me to start anxiety medication and anti-psychotics without base line bloods along with my mother. I refused to take the medication because, truthfully, I didn't know what they were.


The assessment summary report is filled with lies and apparently pointing at where New York is on a map after being asked where it is indicates a lack of flexibility of thought. The flexibility of thought and sensory issue sections are the most ridiculous in my opinion. Every single sentence in the former is a lie and the latter, my God, it is a bunch of trash. 


I lost access to my EHCP plan after my laptop broke but I vividly remember it saying I had enuresis, asthma and an obsession with toilet paper and shoving it down the toilet. I have none of those things and I never have. The toilet paper obsession part likely comes from when my mother moved my bed and saw the amount of toilet paper down the side of it. No, I didn't have an obsession with it; I was crying myself to sleep every night. She never asked or talked about it to me and reached that conclusion on her own. I asked my mother why I got tested for enuresis and I was told it was because I held my pee in instead of asking the teacher to go the toilet due to anxiety. Enuresis is when you cannot control your bladder, so I wouldn't have been able to hold it in.


There is a lot more but again, I do not want to make this too long. As of now, I am in a special school and I hate it. I'm also struggling with my gender identity which, unsurprisingly, has been blamed on my 'autism' and so I have no help whatsoever with it.


What do you think I should do? This entire thing might not sound very serious, but it is taking a very big toll on my mental health. I might have forgotten to list some things, but oh well.


Some other things I think may possibly be important:


+  I am thirteen years old, turning fourteen in June
+  I am not allowed to choose what clothes I wear
+  I am not allowed to go out the house on my own
+  My mother and nan blame everything on the autism ('your life was fine until autism reared its ugly head')
+  My nan works in a special school and is apparently educated on autism
+  My nan thinks everyone in the family has autism when they don't have the signs of it
+  My nan believes my five year old sister has ADHD when its normal for a child her age to show symptoms of it and she has never had an ADHD episode in her life
+  My mom and nan always assume the worst case scenario -- I hit my hand recently and it has been shaking. I think I sprained it and it is normal for it to shake after its been sprained. They both said they think its nerve damage or a trapped nerve.
+  My mom and nan say my dad is arrogant when he really isn't
+  My mom and dad cannot agree on how they split up -- my mom says he cheated on her, I guess, and my dad says she would sometimes throw irons at him and tell him to be like another man"
"Alrighty,

So this girl I use to talk to years ago where we both had feelings for each other but we both never admitted it and nothing came out of it, recently came back into my life as we ended up in the same university course. We got along so well and it was awesome, I started to develop feelings for her again and I told her, Only to be told that she wasn’t looking for anything at the moment. I was perfectly ok with that response as I was just glad to get it off my chest after so long. The only thing now is, we still see each other every week and it’s GREAT. As in we get along so well still and we are getting to know each other more and more. Ultimately meaning my feelings aren’t disappearing and are honestly getting stronger. It’s like I have all this love to give, but I have to hold it in. I find it hard to move on when the person was so nice about it and we still are becoming closer every time we see each other and as we get to know each other."
"So I'm in high school and there is a girl in my school that I really like, but I don't know how to get her Interested in me. I get shy around girls even though I feels it's normal talking to girls, it just makes me shy and don't know what to say. 

I started massaging her, she invited me to go out with her and a couple of her friends a bunch of times, (she was the only one I knew from her friends) but I felt like she started losing Interest, since she answers my massages after a day and doesn't keep up the conversation.

What do I do?"
"I'm only 13. I feel like this is already too much for me. It started off in 2018. My dad caught something like parkinsons. He was going through a lot of stress at that time. He always used to go abroad to conferances. Then he sold his company. That was a big milestone for our family, and probably we wouldn't be in the position we were without him selling it. He had a huge surrounding of people. A lot of people respected him. Like literally. But then, just after he sold his company, it struck. He couldn't even use a fork. He couldn't talk to us. I couldn't understand him. As a 9-10 year old, I didn't understand it much. But I knew something was up. And now, after 3 years, he is a bit more fine. He has significantly improved. He used to weigh a lot, even before his disease and drunk too much. Also he was smoking. With my mom pushing him, he lost a lot of weight, doesn't drink as much and ''quit'' smoking(I will get on to that). So he is even more healthier then his older self. Without that condition of his, he would be real good. Even though he improved, he didn't fully. One day, he is the dad I once knew. And another day, he is a brand new person, a person that makes me sad. It didn't bother me that much, I just lived on with it. 

A few months ago, my sister found some cigarettes in his pocket. We didn't bother with it that much. Then, a few weeks ago, I saw him smoking. That struck real hard for me. I always thought he was doing his best for the family. Trying his hardest to destroy this condition and become more stabilized. 

&amp;#x200B;

My mom has been dealing with this for 3 years. She finally blew up today. This was the first time I legit saw her crying. That is hard for me. I wan't to be normal. I wan't to play some sports with my dad or do something together. That just doesn't work. There was a friend meetup yesterday, and turns out my dad made my mother really emberrased. She said that he couldn't pick up a piece of food a family friend brought to us and everyone looked at him. That is true, he even has a hard time wearing his jacket. He spends like 5 minutes on it without our help. This has gone to a point that everyone looks down to my dad as miserable. That makes me so angry. He is still an angel at heart. Those people don't know him like we do. He used to be the most energetic person I have ever known, and that dad I knew a few years ago still is. He was the most succesful and smart, he graduated from one of the leading universities. Seeing him like that just makes me feel crushed. I wan't to do something. I still warn him to stand up right, talk more clearly but that doesn't seem to work that much. He recently got his eyes burning which is a symptom of parkinsons. I think he feels pyshologically locked to that one steorotype people put him in, his self esteem in the ground. When my mom tries to warn him, he just gets angry. They both have no left tolerance for eachother. But when I speak to him about this, he doesn't get angry. I'm tired of them arguing. I'm tired of reminding my dad to be a dad every day. I feel like he isn't trying his best. If he was trying his best, I would still feel fine about his condition, and he would at least be in a stabilized place. He has doctor he goes to now and then, and after that meetup with his doctor, he just goes back to his old self. And the other day, he is filled with that wall of dark smoke once again. He is trapped in there. He can't express himself. When he does sports, he goes back to being his old self. And covered with smoke the other day. When he goes to sleep early, the same thing. Why doesn't he do those things I wrote all the time? Why does he still smoke?  

Does he wan't to spend the rest of his life like a 90 year old grandpa or stand up and do something? Not just for himself, for us. He shouldn't do sports for like two days and think that he is fine. It is like going in a diet, losing weight, and gaining that weight all over again. One of the things my dad achieved is a healthier diet. It's his lifestyle now. The other things should be too. I feel like I should do something, talk to him, atleast. I want to express my feelings to him. Maybe then he can have a constant motivation of being better. It's time for him to take responsibility. What should I do?"
"I'm 20 years old in college, living at home with my parents while I'm in school. My parents are not rich but we have the average middle-class life and well enough to get by. They came to America when they were young so I could live and enjoy life and be happy, they work hard and I'm grateful for that. 

During the summers I just want to have time to relax and enjoy the summer which I know is pretty privileged but if I have the opportunity to not have to work and have fun I feel like I should take it and not have to feel guilty. I'm gonna work for the rest of my life why not enjoy it while I can.

All my friends have to get part-time jobs and work during the summer weeks and I feel guilty that I'm not doing that. Mainly because I don't have to pay rent, groceries, or other bills like that but personally I feel like if my parents brought me into this world they should have to pay for all those things which they do which I am grateful for that.

Should I feel guilty about this? My friends have been passive-aggressive about this before and I try my hardest to make sure I don't show my privilege and show I'm grateful for everything. What do I do?"
"Recently a girl I know told me that she made out with the big of one of my friends. She claimed she didn’t know they were already together and he didn’t stop it or anything. She also said he‘s still chatting with other girls and asking for nudes. 
I always thought that guy was kinda an ass so I belived her. He also cheated before he got together with my friend. I said we‘d have to tell her because she is anxious about that kind of stuff.

We decided to meet with them both in a few days and tell them what we know.

Since then a few days have passed and I start to question my decision. 
I‘m probably going to break up a couple. Is it really my decision to make ? But I also can‘t pretend nothing happened. I don’t want to lie to her."
"Hi hello basically, friend kinda liked this guy, then he said some stuff that made her uncomfortable, he then started violating her boundaries by texting her and saying she never said when she did, most of the group don't like him because of this but some are still open to him being around, proceeded to say that my friend is cutting him off from all his friends (we aren't his friends just associated with him besides a few.) and saying we're blaming all of my friend's anxitey on him. Because it is his fault for being around her and violating her boundaries. His sister got involved and saying my friend is being inconsiderate for doing this.

So any advice is appreciated. I have steel toe boots if that helps anything. Yes we have tried telling teachers but nothing can stop that."
"Hello, It's not something very bad. My brother-in-law and sister gave me a proposal enrolling me in an online course for what ever specific skill set I wish to enroll especially since I'm looking for a job now. I finished my BS degree SY 2018-19. I KNOW IT SOUNDS GREAT OPPORTUNITY, but the thing is, I developed Major Depression with suicidal tendency, psychotic, and anger issues. I went to my doctor on my own after grad since my family's opinion at the time was ""you can do whatever you set your mind on"" which clearly isn't helping me. I almost end up killing a person due to my rage... I'm under medication and it's helping me but what developed this problem was during my university years. It's standard that we mostly don't get a sleep, I was proud to go on for 3 days without sleep at some point. That was one time but I really stay most nights to finish school works.

What do you think? I'm thankful for the offer but I'm holding back at the same time going back to study + working at home (hopefully if I get accepted on the job)."
"Hello! My name's Ria and 13 years old. Please, just don't click off due to my age. Teens have lot to say. anyhow, Let's get to the reason I need advice.

&amp;#x200B;

About 2 months ago, I met this boy. He was 15 and he lived in Europe (i shall not be specifying where in Europe just for his privacy. We both had many common interests, and 2 days later he asked me to be his girlfriend, which i accepted. About a month and a half went by, we were pretty happy with each other. A few days ago (approximately 3), he started ghosting me. We used to text on discord, so I could see when he was online. So, he was online but he never replied to my messages. Then today, he deleted his wattpad profile, left all the group chats we both were in, and de it was like he never existed.

 

So after this incident, what was the outcome or the effect on me? well.. yes it broke me. I was in love with that person, and it was like loving a wall. It hurt me so much. But at the same time, i hope he's happy and has a good life.  


(any advice for getting over him?)

so for now, farewell"
"Pretty dumb to be posting this, but I used to get along with a coworker (18-19 just graduated high school) and I (22 years old)  thought we were friends. Last Thursday, everything was fine. However, on Friday he just started ignoring me, like not looking at me in the eye and making weird faces. I said ""What's up with you?"" and he said, ""I'm just in a bad mood."" Well, obviously he seems to be getting along with everyone else in his friend group normally now and made amends with a girl he just poured water on for a laugh to try to get her attention I think. So it's just me.

Before this, I called him out and said it wasn't nice to be pouring water on somebody for a laugh. I also told the victim that he said it was for ""entertainment"" for a laugh once I saw her reaction. Their little feud was kind of funny, but pouring water is still not nice. I also told him that he was a chill, nice guy but is sometimes meaner than I expect him to be. 

After the weekend, on Monday, the same behavior repeated again. This time with dirty looks whenever I would just be doing my job and giving him boxes that he is supposed to pick off from the belt that are in my area (I work in a fedex warehouse). He got mad and claimed that I could just pick the boxes for him, when they are supposed to be for his area anyway.

I think what is unnerving was how who I thought was a friend quickly changed their tune around me at the drop of a hat. It was really sudden. He also is close friends with somebody I'm also not on the best terms with right now who I just stopped talking to. However, I'm pretty sure his friend is in his ear regarding his opinions towards me.

Should I confront him about it, or just not waste my energy on this? I made a goal for myself to not be dragged down by others opinions of me, and meditate in order to let negative feelings pass, not become myself. I'm also moving out of the area within 3-4 weeks and don't really plan to keep in contact with anybody from fedex. I really did enjoy getting along with him, but I'm not sure if I should just be over this."
"I'm in the middle of semester in merciless Europe High School. There's three waves of exams; three exams per 7 subjects. I failed every single exam out, I failed 1/3 out of the exams and the other 2/3 are yet to come; I just had a math exam from the 2nd wave and I terribly failed. I will graduate in one year but if I fail this semester they'll just kick me out and with my current marks I'm three times a goner. I want the degree, finally after 3,5 years I spent in the building doubting all the time I finally convinced myself I WANT the degree, but they'll trash me out if I don't compensate marks. 

I'm bad at maths, I'm bad at physics and I'm bad in chemistry. I failed English, I failed French, my History mark doesn't add any points to the soup, I failed Economy and Biology as well. I'm pretty much fucked if I go on like I did until. I can't go vanish with the second rain of exams because then I'm 100% a goner. How do I stop cramming everything in the last day? How do I save a semester I already failed to a gradient of 1/3?"
"\*FYI THIS IS HAS BEEN GOING ON FOR A YEAR AND 4 MONTHS\*

My freshmen year of college I met this girl named Chris. She seem pretty nice and I liked her. We started talking and during that time I came at her very straight forward. I wasn't looking for anything serious. One thing led to another and we ended up having sex twice. Between that we would occasionally message each other here and there. She gave me flags but not major ones. For example, she would refer to me as ""baby"" or ""bae"". I would correct her and remind her that I'm not looking for a relationship. Now the big red flag was while we were having sex she told me that she loved me. That gave me the sign that she was getting in too deep. So for a week I didn't text her or talk to her in class. She would blow up my phone by sending text messages to me on snapchat. She even went as far as emailing me on my student email for college. Once I seen that I finally reached out to her. I told her how I felt and she seem to understand. After that Chris's ""best friend"" started to text me on Instagram from a fake account. The account was saying that she wants me bc Chris would brag about me and the  ""best friend""  wants anything that Chris has. When I declined her offer she started to texting me saying that she was going to kill Chris. This is not even the worst of it. As soon as I seen that I immediately screenshot that conversation and sent it to Chris. Chris told me that her best friend is not  her best friend anymore bc she's crazy and always try's to go after the guys that Chris talks to or ends up dating. I eventually told Chris that I don't want to do anything with her. She asked if we could still be friends and I was cool with that. Until 2 months later I started talking to a girl that I met in high school. We really hit it off. One night I was on facetime with her and she decided to like all my photos on Instagram and I did that same to her profile as well. Apparently my Instagram was being watched bc as soon as I did that I got sent a message from the fake profile again with a sc (screenshot) of my girl liking all of my photos. When I seen that I started to panic and became scared bc I didn't want the new girl that I'm talking too, being scared bc of this situation. The next day the new girl I'm talking to (I will call her Sarah), got a text from a the fake account too. Saying to ""leave my man alone"", that cause a big problem between her and I bc she thought I was playing her. I ended up telling her everything and she didn't like it. I'm going to fast forward a bit. 2 weeks later, I get a random text with a photo attached to it. The text says "" we have just found out that Chris was found dead and its all your fault"". The picture that was attached to it was kind of like a death pan flit that people give out at funeral's. Whoever sent it to me and Sarah, who was working at that time. I started to cry, Sarah was having a panic attack at work. It was literally one of the worst days of my life. My family found out what was going on and found out that on the photo that was sent, what read sounded like a prom invitation. Later down the line I found out that it was all a lie. This is when I would say it, the cyberstalking really started. I overall think its Chris due to the nature of the fake account but I don't have no real proof. Mind you I have already filed multiple reports on Chris, but the situation is still not being solved. All the police said was just to not reply and sc any messages, but in the past months the harassment has been going too far. Like the accounts spread from Instagram to Facebook. Its not just stalking and harassing me. The accounts also been going after my friends, people I graduated high school with, and even my current girlfriend Sarah and her family too. I'm just really tired of this man. I don't know how much more I can take. This has been affecting my schooling, my work life, and my relationships. I just want all of this to be gone and done. I feel like I'm hanging off the edge and about to fall off. Can anyone please give me advice. I beg you...."
"Hello,

I am 19 and I have always kind of been nervous when it came to altercations, mostly bc if never been in one and no one has ever taught me how to fight. I would like to learn to defend myself and others around me, like my gf, but genuinely have no idea where to start? Does anyone have any advice, literally anything helps!!! Thanks!"
"I'm sure most of you are aware of India's current Covid-19 situation. There's a \[shortage of vaccines\]([https://www.financialexpress.com/lifestyle/health/vaccine-stocks-down-vaccination-rate-falling-where-is-the-road-map-on-the-inoculation-drive/2248252/](https://www.financialexpress.com/lifestyle/health/vaccine-stocks-down-vaccination-rate-falling-where-is-the-road-map-on-the-inoculation-drive/2248252/)) and a ton of misinformation about the hospitals in my city being spread. 

I want to create a platform that allows people to share their experiences (time taken, social distancing followed etc.)  Apart from a google sheet, what would be the best way platform to do so? Any help would be appreciated. 

Or please direct me to a more appropriate subreddit!"
All dreams were some variation of me being cheated on and left by my fiance. I’ve always had trust issues from past trauma but we’re very open w/ each other and together almost all the time. I trust him but I have extreme anxiety and the constant fear of being left. Help.
"So recently I found out that my ex is dating someone. At first I was happy for him because he found someone new. But now a part of me is really sad and I find myself crying at night. We broke up a couple months ago and I just don’t understand why I have these periods of sadness. Again, I’m happy for him and I’m not spiteful. I just don’t know. Anyone know how to get over a heartache?"
It's not like I'm a late bloomer either.
"So we've been playing together for a while now and he seems genuinely interested in pursuing something more than a friendship but I made it clear from the get go, that I don't date, even if it's long distance or whatever can come out of gaming together. I don't do relationships not even sleeping around because it's just not me and I'm okay with that you know. I just can't seem to open up to a guy in a way that would class as more than friends. I'm quite open but if I feel like they want more than being friends, then I shut off a lil.

I don't know how to feel about this guy because he flirts around a lot and it comes off as a joke and I rebuff it. I never flirt back with anyone and just joke back. I like the guy as a friend and he said the same too but sometimes I feel like he's really trying to get me to open up more and he'll bring up the possibilities of me being in a relationship quite often.

To be honest I thought he was either a 'nice guy' or an fboy from the first couple of times I met him because of the things he said but after getting to know him, it doesn't seem to be the case. I've watched movies with the guy online cause he suggested it and I didn't mind cause I didn't think much of it but in hindsight, was it something that could make him think that I'm interested in him? I mean he knows that I don't like men (not a man hater just had really bad experiences with men since a child till now and its put me off from wanting to date) and he's brought it up, so he's aware but am I stringing him along by wanting to game or watch movies with him? I genuinely don't think much of it and I made it all clear to him but I don't know what to do when someone wants me to open up to them in a completely different way. 

I'm not sure how to approach this, so just some insight into this will be greatly appreciated."
"i don’t know whats wrong with me. it feels like every group of friends i’ve ever had get, like, boring or annoying to me after being in them for so long. i’ve had, like, eight different groups of people i’ve cycled through over the last six years or something.

i haven’t had to find new groups out of necessity, i’ve lived in the same place and i never really had drama with anyone, my brain just switches and i get bored of those people and i move to a different group. some of the groups i know they never broke off and they’re all still friends with each other. i was the outlier. i fizzled out for no apparent reason.

sometimes it’s happened that i find the new group of people before my brain really starts getting bored with them, and so i just end up moving because one group is, like, newer to my brain and thus more interesting and more fun to be around. other times my opinion of my group changes and i fall out of it and then i’m just alone for a while.

it happens with individual people, too. this group i’m in now, i haven’t been able to be best friends with the same person for more than four months or something.

i wouldn’t choose to be alone if i could. i like people. if i could choose the way my brain acted i would make it so that i wanted to be around groups of people when we’ve been friends for a long time and they haven’t done anything wrong. but i can’t choose it. i just get sick of being around them and it’s all a subconscious thing. it’s like there’s a voice in my head that starts judging them for every little thing they do. i get sick of hearing their voices. but i don’t want to hate them. i have literally no reason for getting so pissy around them. i’m willing to be and capable of being their friend so why doesn’t my head want me to do that anymore??

i got in a relationship three months ago and now my head won’t stop acting like everything they do is annoying. i asked them for a break a few days ago because i just couldn’t make myself care after how much my brain randomly turned on them. i didn’t want the responsibility of maintaining a relationship i wasn’t invested in.

is this, like, wrong? is this something i can solve? also is there a term for this?

this happens every 6-12 months or something and i especially don’t want it to be happening right now. i’m about to fly across the country to meet this group in person. i want it to go away so i can resume my relationship and have a good trip with all of them :("
My dad works from home. My mom works a 9 to 5. We live in a apartment so I don't feel comfortable jerking off with someone else in the house. It's been a solid 3 weeks since I last did it. Help.
"I don't like my job and I want to find something new. I'll spare you the details. What I'm worried about isn't about the job itself. It's because the minute I become unemployed, my mom is going to force me to work for her business under her and my stepdad. They'll pay me, but I don't want to do the kind of work they want me to do, period.

Last summer my mom told me to get a job, and forced me to work for her doing hard physical labor until I found one. I about nearly killed myself for two weeks. I'm not in the best shape so it was absolute hell for me. I was paid for my time, but I was still being forced to work against my will. My mom gets scary when she's mad. I was afraid to go against her because she would definitely do something to my belongings.

That's again what I'm worried about. I want to quit my job, and I know she'll tell me to come work for her, ""or else"" (this is what she said before when I told her I didn't want to work for her last summer). I've since moved most of my most valuable belongings to my grandparents' house, where I've lived for the last 14 months. However, I don't think that would stop my mom. I still have some things left in my room at my house, and she'd definitely go after them first as punishment. Next, I don't believe it's unlikely that she'd drive over to my grandparents' house and them come take my stuff by force.

Her excuse will probably be, ""I bought these things, so they're mine"". Keep in mind I am almost 20, by the way. Most of the things I own I received as gifts or were otherwise bought for me without conditions over the years. Even though she spent her money on these things, me being a legal adult, I don't think she has any legal right to take them back. If I were a minor, I think this would be a different situation, but I'm not.

What should I do if she tries to force me to work under her again under threat of taking my belongings if I quit my job? Do I have a real reason to go to the police over that? But in that case, I'll probably permanently ruin my relationship with her."
"I’ll try to keep it brief.

First, I have a scholarship that covers all my tuition. This is the good part.

Second, I have already completed two years of school, and I have no idea if I’m making the most out of it. I feel like I may be wasting my time.

This is the part where I gotta elaborate. Basically, I am a Psychology major, but also am aiming for the pre-med track. Grades-wise, I’ve been faltering both from lack of motivation on my own part and factors outside of my control.

Now, the latter is subsiding, so thankfully, I’ve been able to get back some of my original motivation. However, I still have the problem of putting two years worth of mediocrity behind me.

Even my grades in my major, which I’m sincerely passionate about, have taken a hit on behalf of keeping chemistry afloat, and I have to wonder, am I just stretching myself too thin? It’s not too bad, maybe around a B- for the major itself. Salvageable, but far from ideal and it really bothers me how little I get to study it. My Chem is more around a C, with the labs for both it and Physics at a D. 

My question then becomes this. Do I cut my losses and, in turn, cut pre-med loose?

Further explanation about my goals: I’m quite interested in Research Psychology, but primarily, I still want to treat patients as a clinician. I still think both of these are achievable without an MD, but sucks to take a blow to my future pay. Thing is, I don’t feel like there’s much of a future on this path.

Bonus Question:
Moreover, I’m very interested in cultivating art as, at the very least, as a side hobby, and at the most optimally, a side hustle in its own right. My main concern is that pre-med really cuts into this in a very obtrusive manner. However, with it out of the way, I could pursue art minors, considering the aforementioned scholarship would make it free. Waste of time, or a good deal?"
"I used to see my father as my hero, just like any other kid. As I grew up, I found out my mom divorced him because he cheated on her with several other women during their engagement, did drugs (sometimes leaving them out wherever in the house, putting me at risk for accidentally eating one), constantly went to casinos, went to jail thrice, and was overall an ass. 

I realized how he would always put his own child second to his own needs and egoistical self. He was a borderline uninvolved parent and put all the work on my mom for raising me. I cut him off because I knew it was for the best (especially after he made me pee in a bottle to hide the fact that he was still doing drugs [I was ten when this happened so I had no idea just how bad that was]) . Besides, I found out he never wanted to have a child to begin with. Nonetheless, the memories I thought were good ones with him stuck with me, like how he would call me his little monkey, buy me ice cream occasionally, take me to the movies, etc.

I remember when my mom was in the process of divorcing him, he would stalk her because he was obsessed with her, would use me as a way to get closer to her, and one time made a hole in the wall out of anger after she refused to call off the divorce. Yes, he was a bad person. 

Either way, I can't help but remember the ""hero"" I used to have. I feel so disappointed knowing that the moments I cherished with him probably meant nothing to him. I have a step-dad who treats me a lot better than my father ever did, so it's not like I'm lacking a fatherly figure. My mom is hardworking, stays healthy, and teaches me the right things, so why do I still feel this way? I had amazing grades in school, my group of friends, and led what many would consider a fortunate and happy life. I know my worth and know that it's best to cut him off and not contact him. 

I want to let go of my father completely but I can't. I want to hate him after all he did but I can't bring myself to do so. Why do I feel this way? What should I do?"
"The year before the pandemic I opened a lawsuit against the school district based on bullying, the reason was well the captcha is saying I was picked up as the most disliked person int he school.

I currently work 9-5, but we have the option of working 7-3 or 8-4, so I was thinking of switching to 7-3 and then the classes are 4-8 tues-thurs and 10-6 on Saturday’s. My manager is willing to give me work relating to what I’m studying so that I can practice, but I’m concerned that these hours for 6 months might make me burnt out.

"One of my friends got way too drunk and told me hes killed two people. 
I don't really know what to do. 
Any advice will help."
" I'm stuck in sort of a loop. Each one of my family members thrives by seeing themselves surpass others. They mentally ignore the good traits of their fellow family members, so that they can construct an inner narrative that they're the best. They're always thinking of themselves. Just yesterday, on mother's day, my siblings decided to do nothing for my mom. She was downstairs, cleaning, preparing food.. she worked her ass off, only for no one to recognize the work she put in. I was the only child to even give her anything. Mother's day is extremely important to her they know this. I guess, somehow, they came to the conclusion that she wasn't deserving of their attention... and that's my problem. Everyone's trapped in their own little world. whining about how bad their lives are. In reality, their lives aren't bad. I've seen my siblings frame the fact that they have to clean a toilet as genuine abuse. They've been through so little, that even the smallest fault feels like the world to them.. and they love it. they love to writhe in their supposed misfortunes, unaware that anyone who is truly suffering would want nothing of the sort. They're always asking themselves why their lives are so bad, while also refusing to even raise a limb to move out of the way. they use their conditions as excuses for their incompetence. They legitimately, actively look for traumas to loathe about. One of my siblings cited getting embarassed in the middle of class once as some horrible experience. this was nearly 7 years ago, mind you. They tried to one up me, proclaiming that they undermine their own experiences. This was in response to me wanting to talk about the constant beratement I was subjugated to on a daily basis for 3 years straight.. No one took me seriously. Because of rumors, the entire middle school hated me, and dunked on me every day. I lost so many friends, and was manipulated and used deeply, again and again. It felt like such an insult when that sibling used a one-off instance to one-up me. I don;t like to dwell on the past, however. I've used my faults to boost myself up. I'm not perfect, i know. I mean, I'm going to a sub about relatively small familial issue. i just need help with how to 1. get taken seriously (im regarded as an sjw and sad leftist for saying stuff like 'gay people in tv is a good idea' and being gay, myself.) and 2. Make everyone happy again.. make everybody love each other, instead of constantly complaining."
"there is this guy that I have liked for 6 years. I’m not even sure if he knows because I don’t really make it obvious. We used to text 6years ago for around a year and then stopped texting and just seen each other at school for the others year and then I recently made an instagram and he requested me and texted me &amp; asked me where I’ve been for the past year since I went social media free. He told me how I’m the only girl he doesn’t get annoyed of. He’s called me hot before. Me and him share the same hobbies such as guitar, piano and singing. He texts me during his work hours. Should I tell him I’m interested in him and if so how should I say it?"
"I didn’t really know what to title this, so there you go!
Okay, I know this is going to sound weird, but hear me out.

Since… about maybe January I’ve been having breathing difficult that got progressively worse. 
Long story short, I have had the virus… but I have since tested negative and have the late stage antibodies. I am also fully vaccinated (and that includes waiting 1-2 weeks).

Last month, I had such difficulties breathing that I had to see a doctor. Bloodwork was done, in addition to a chest x-ray. Both ended up with nothing showing as wrong. Basically, I was completely healthy except for very low vitamin d levels. Under my doctor’s advisement, since May 5th I started taking 5,000 IU per day.

Nothing seems to help. I still have breathing difficulties, as well as a loss of smell. Basically, I smell nothing… everyone else in my household hasn’t been having these issues… my nose’s abilities are pretty much dead, currently nonexistent. In addition to those, I’ve also had little headaches. Occasionally (very little, more so sporadic but always after I wake up) I’ll wake up with a migraine. 

So I’m a painter. I use acrylic paint, most of which is no more than 4-5 months old. Actually more like 1-3, I tend to go through certain paint colors a lot. I don’t empty my paint water out every day, I pretty much use it until it starts to smell. And I’m not talking a moldy smell, more like rotten eggs… sulfur. I know I leave it out for much longer than I should, but I always forget.

Being the hypochondriac that I am, I did some research. What I think it is, is hydrogen sulfide from leaving the paint water out too long. The symptoms make sense, but I could always be wrong.

Is it what I think it is? Or, is it something else? If it IS, what do I do, how do I handle this? 

I could really use some advice, this is not something I’ve ever experienced before. And looking it up only yielded the symptoms and general things, not much help.

Any advice will be greatly appreciated! 
Also if some of this doesn’t make sense, sorry. My brain has been in a bit of a fog lately, and I’m a little tired/sleepy."
"I really need some advice on how to talk to someone.
So basically I started talking to this guy, we're from the same area and share a lot if interests.

The only problem is that I am really shy and anxious when it comes to talking to people. I haven't been in any relationship before (I'm almost 20) so I worry about coming off as rude or weird. The conversations really aren't forced and we can talk for hours on end but I don't want him to feel like he's the only one interested in talking, but I'm not sure how to go on about it. We get along so well and it would be a shame to let this go just because I'm shy.

If everything goes well I may be able to meet up with him sooner or later but I don't want him to do all the work"
"Hello,

My brother is in the 6th grade, and I've been really suspicious and concerned about him for a while now. It seemed like he had way too much time to play/game, and every time I would ask him if he did his homework, he would answer yes. Besides this, he seemed to not be taking care of himself, like showering daily or skipping meals. I ended up checking his school laptop today, and I found out that he had missing assignments for the last two quarters of school, with dozens of missing assignments for a majority of his classes. It turns out he was also ignoring emails about academic probation, and he was being dishonest about it.  I confronted him about it, and he ended up lying for a bit until I asked to be honest and then he broke down crying. My parents, along with everyone else, was not aware of this since there wasn't any emails or phone calls about him failing. I'm extremely worried that he might be retained since he has multiple F's for the last few quarters (grades can not be changed for quarters once they end), but I also want to do my best to comfort/support him. He just transitioned into a more rigorous grade level from elementary school, and he also seems to struggle with motivation with distance learning. How can I best support him during this time and teach him to be more honest? What can I do to help him through his coursework? I don't know what to say except checking up on him and saying it's alright since he seems genuinely sad/distressed."
"am I being over dramatic or are my parents actually are so controlling?

So I’m a 17 year old muslim female. My parents don’t let me wear pants I have to wear a long skirt because men are attracted to legs. I can’t talk to a boy if he isn’t my teacher or law related. I can’t have any form of social media. I can’t post my face on social media either or I will get hit badly. I can’t ride a bike until after I’m married because a bike is known to break women’s hymen’s same goes for riding a horse. I can’t choose who I want to marry I’m currently being forced to marry a random man and I can’t say no. However I’m allowed to work, go to school &amp; drive. I can’t show my voice to social media, I can’t even post a picture of my hand. I’m not allowed to move out until I’m married. 

If I say I don’t want kids they say “it’s not your choice, you have to have children” they put me up to such high standards. I still have to ask them if I can go out with my friends even if I turn 30"
"I recently moved back home to take care of my parents. I don’t regret it, but I just feel quite lonely as much as I try not to. I’m single, all my friends are far away, busy settling down for the most part, and I’m not sure how do I start mingling around here as a 28 year old with no friends. Sometimes I try and I get some remark about why I don’t seem to have friends and it just sets me back even more. I feel like I’m going down a hole of loneliness as I age."
"I'm 30 and most of my friends are basically broke.

I inherited $75k and also made a modest $50k the last couple of years and worked throughout 2020, so I consider myself fortunate. I also had my college paid for by my parents and have no debt.

But also, I feel like my salary is low compared to most professionals.

I don't like talking about money and live a modest life. I recently got laid off and was telling one of my friends that I was going to take a few months off and they couldn't see how that was possible.

Most of my friends have like $5k in the bank. And I have over $100k.

Should I become friends with lawyers and doctors or is this the norm?"
We're really close and I love him. But he doesn't know if he feels the same way romantically about me yet. Well I got very drunk (still am as i write this) and i sent him a voice message opening up a tad bit about a traumatic piece of my history. I was definitely crying too. Should i unsend before he wakes up or should i leave myself vulnerable?
"So I recently met this girl on a dating app and we have been really hitting it off and been talking 24/7 for about a week now and  gotten to know each other really well but one thing I’m afraid of her knowing is that I’m a nicotine addict, low key a pothead and a bit of a drinker i’m really not sure how to put it out there without being weird or ruining things I don’t know I’m just not sure what she thinks about that and I don’t want it to change her perspective on me. Can anyone give me some advice on this situation."
"Hi everyone. For context, I am not in the US.

So, I am feeling overwhelmed the past days. I feel like my life is falling apart - work, finance, and family-wise.

I became unemployed 3 months ago. I was supposed to transition to another job, but for some reason, it did not happen. So I ended up being unemployed. I job searched for the past months but until now, to no avail. I sent lots of applications but only few responded - either I am not fit for the job or I am overqualified.

Problem is, my bills are piling. Loan collectors are calling me now, and even private loans from family and friends, they are asking me to pay (I loaned some because I became sick last March and needed money). I have a part time job but it is only enough for my daily needs. 

I am becoming overwhelmed and anxious. What made it worse was that my dad and I fought over this morning because he said I am 'useless'. They do not know that I am unemployed and I don't want to tell them because I would hear lot of painful words again.

I really do not know what to do. I wanted to run away. Today, I received many messages asking me to pay up and it increased my anxiety level. I really want to run away.

What is the best way to handle this situation because my mind is being clouded."
"Work is getting so slow that I’d make more on unemployment, but I’m looking into a job that offers 2$ more per hour with plenty of opportunities for overtime, just need to submit a resume, which I’ve never really wrote one before, so any advice would be a huge help"
"He seems like he's just been really depressed lately, he lost his job and everything he's been trying at he's been failing at. Hes now sleeping later and eating like once a day and he's also lost interest in being intimate. About a year ago he also lost his only parent but he seemed like he was coping as well as one can at the time so I think its just a lack of a job and motivation. I want to plan a getaway or vacation but he's acting pretty sullen and has no interest in going anywhere right now. I'm just looking for some fun surprises or a spontaneous adventure for us to do. Something that will at least make him a little happier and get his mind working?"
"My husband's friend just lost his wife in a car crash. I didn't even know them that well, we only met a couple times, but I feel devastated--and like it shouldn't bother me as much as it does. Every time I think about her husband or two young kids I get a lump in my throat. Is this normal? I don't know why I feel this way. It's confusing and heartbreaking and I'm just feeling all the things."
"Hey guys, I'm 17 and for the past 3 months, a lot of pressure from my studies have been affecting me mentally.

I mean this pressure eventually leads to all areas of my life, plus the lockdown, hasn't allowed any physical exercises or even being able to go out.

Along with this, very weird Thoughts have been coming into my mind in the past few weeks, like running away or even worse... It's not like I want it, but it seems like the only thing to do.

The pressure is insane, to the point where everyone is saying that if I don't put insane effort, my future is completely going to be a mess. I want to put that effort but all these factors are just screwing me up, emotionally as well.

I wanted to know how to fortify my mind and deal with the pressure.

Thank you."
"I'm want to try computer science, but I'm not sure I'm too late to do so."
"Reddit, I’m a fairly successful woman in my early 30s and have quite a few friends and interests. But I’m consumed by regret and can’t break out of my obsessive, cyclical thought patterns.

Despite being fairly academic, I was really badly bullied at school and didn’t live up to my full potential. When it came to choosing a university, I ended up going to an ugly, unimpressive uni, the sort that people pull a face about whenever I begrudgingly admit I went there. 

By this point I had really bad mental health problems and ended up having some big fall outs. I ended my time at university completely miserable, friendless and filled with regret. 

My early twenties were a complete mess and centred around an unhealthy relationship. I got fired from loads of jobs, a memory which still makes me feel really anxious and insecure. I also made some stupid decisions, eg getting into debt, following said boyfriend to another country where I studied for a masters in a subject that was more him than me. 

When I returned, I started to get help, taking antidepressants and having counselling. I also started to get more relevant work experience and training and, at 26, finally landed a decent job in field relevant to my interests. Life has felt more solid since, but I feel very behind in many ways. I have also recently had to move back to my parents’ house because I was living in an unsafe flat-share and don’t earn enough to live alone. This situation has has knocked my confidence considerably.

I hope to move out again soon, and am grateful to have a place to go, but this isn’t how I saw myself at this age. I always longed to live somewhere far away from the place I grew up. I didn’t expect to be wealthy, but I thought I’d at least earn enough to rent a studio flat in a suitable area.

My life is okay on the surface, and I don’t want to sound ungrateful. But underneath I’m a broken mess, and constantly feel inadequate. I so wish I’d done better at school and gone on to study at a prestigious university. I wish I’d made solid friendships during those lost years. I wish my career had kicked off earlier so I could have travelled more and had a wider range of experiences.

I just keep thinking about all the time I’ve wasted over the years, time spent crying in bed or being too scared to leave the house. I get flashbacks all the time to when I would behave in a ‘crazy’, paranoid way when I was young and feel so humiliated. 

Every single day I wish I could go back in time and redo my life, lay a more solid foundation for the years ahead. Get help sooner so I could have made the most out of my youth. 

My discomfort is so strong that I find myself not wanting to have children because I feel like I am not ‘enough’. I feel permanently ‘stained’ by my past if that makes sense, and still bear very real reminders in terms of the amount of debt I’m still in.

How do I just accept myself as I am and move forward? I’ve tried counselling and CBT and nothing seems to work. I also don’t want to go back on anti-depressants."
"My sister has come home for several days now talking about how a group of boys in her school are threatening rape on her and a lot of other girls in her school and have been using many racial slurs, but every time she or anyone else reports these behaviours the staff dismiss them with excuses such as girls need to watch what they wear and that boys will be boys. Emails and phone calls have happened and the school refuse to change their stance on this, the girls have even tried to protest but only ended up getting punished, I want to help try and get something done for her but i dont know where to start, any advice?"
"This is no metaphor: My literal dreams I dream at night keep me from getting up.

To clarify: I am a very active dreamer and ever since covid started I have had a harder and harder time getting up in the morning. I never was a morning person to begin with, but when I woke up I always had something to look for in my day. Going out in the evening, spending time at the lake, see something new and exciting and also just meeting my friends at school or later university. But now all my days are the same: Sport, Homeoffice, Lunch, Homeoffice, Dinner, Learning, Going to Bed. My days are boring and suck.

... My dreams on the other hand are super exciting and adventurous. And even if they aren't I still get to see my friends face to face as I dream of them fairly often. My literal dreams are so much better than my real life. And over this I lose all motivation to get up in the first place.

Overall I am usually a fairly disciplined person. I keep a schedule I usually follow very exactly and get my things done on time 95% of the time. I keep healthy habits, even if the are difficult like working out and keeping a healthy diet. But this thing I cannot get under control. Because even losing to it feels better than getting it done, as my life is so stale and my dreams are so vivid.

PLEASE HELP!"
"In Dec 2016/Jan 2017 I met a boy online. We were 17/18 yrs old. We talked every single day for a few years, watching shows together, skyping.... and there was a point in time where he said he loved me. We never met in person, though, so we drifted apart because it’s been 5 years. We’ve had relationships with other people and we’ve gone a few months at a time without speaking, but I still really want to meet him and see him irl and potentially have sex with him. The problem is I’ve tried to schedule trips to see him in the past, but I cancelled last minute due to either getting back with my ex or my parents not allowing me to. Right now I feel like he’s acting a bit dry with  me, probably because he lost hope, but I still want to meet him so bad. It’s a 8h drive. I don’t have a car."
"My ex and I were together for a little over two years, and in the last six months of our relationship things got super rocky. He wanted to break up ever other week, and I would have to tell him that we needed to try to work on it instead of just giving up. After a while, things finally were getting better. We were stable for about two months, and he would tell me he was happy we stayed together and that he was super confident that things would be as good as they used to be between us again. He got a job working at a pizza place, and he would call me every night when he got off and tell me how work was and that he loved me. He started following this girl he worked with on Instagram and Snapchat because she “asked him to.” He told me he thought it was a little weird considering she was 17 it was fine and that she was just a coworker. He then starts driving this girl to work even when he wasn’t working, even early in the morning, and following her on tiktok. I told him this made me uncomfortable, and he got mad at me for not trusting him, and in his words, “it feels like you think I’m a pedophile or something. She’s 17 and she’s just my friend, that’s weird.” A week later, he tells me he is unhappy but he wants to work on it and not break up, and then not even two days later he takes me off his private things on social media, his snap score goes up an insane amount, and he breaks up with me. He tells me he had realized he hasn’t been happy for months and that he doesn’t love me anymore. We made a deal to meet up again in a few months and talk again and see how things went because we still wanted to be together in the future. I unadded him on Snapchat quickly after so I wouldn’t look at his snap score to respect his privacy. That was a month ago, and as of sometime in the last few days he is dating the 17 year old girl he got mad at me for being uncomfortable about. He is telling her that her body is sexy and texting her “good morning sweetheart.” I only know all of this because I was sent a tiktok he made about her by a friend that follows him. Conveniently, he blocked me on tiktok right after he made that post so I wouldn’t see it. I am so unbelievably disgusted and hurt. I have since asked for my things back and blocked his number and blocked him on every social media platform imaginable. I am so hurt and grossed out that I’m having trouble sleeping and I feel incredibly nauseous. How do I cope with this? What am I supposed to do when I’n still in love with a man who is grooming his young coworker? I need any advice I can get. Thank you."

"Hello, I am a 18M who wants to stop this mindset.

The mindset of sexualizing a woman and objectifying her.

Because of a misled education and the hormones of a healthy teen, I have had trouble with sexualizing's Women. I don't want to, But it happens. 

for example: when looking at a woman I would look at her chest or butt and then look at her face.

This has created so many problems for me. I don't like this mindset at all. I have a mother and sister who I care about, I would be honestly get pissed at whoever who looked at them in that manner.

I don't like being a hypocrite, I want to relax and have a conversation with someone without creating fantasies in my mind and objectifying them. I want to respect Women.

Please help me become a better person."
"Hello, im brand new to this sub so I apologize if this doesn’t fit correctly.

For the past three years I’ve thought about an ex-girlfriend almost daily. We’ve hooked up for small period of time after our initial break-up (first a year after, then again about 8 months ago) and it seems like theres still a potential for more of a meaningful relationship.

The most terrible thing for me is that we are both now in separate relationships and she still rests in my mind almost daily. I even bought a small gift the other day just to potentially leave it anonymously for her at her house for Christmas. 

I’m self aware that this might be a little obsessive but I can only reinforce that it’s only a genuinely kind gesture. 

I guess what I want to know is:
Am I holding onto something that I realistically shouldn’t? Or is this uncomfortable reality defining my passion of humanity something I should find comfort in?

I know you all are not shrinks or anything but I would appreciate anything that anyone from the outside has to say about this because I cant really talk to anyone in my life about it because I can barely stand to think about it myself.
Thank you"
"I fcking hate my brain. It keeps on obsessing over useless useless stuff rather than focusing on my studies. I flunked a viva today, badly. I'm literally feeling so fcking dumb I was sitting there like an idiot who doesn't know a thing about labour whereas I spent the whole night tirelessly mugging every topic in obstetrics except the one part I was questioned on. I had the answers of almost all questions that were asked to others because I had read those topics but I left the one portion I was quizzed on. And in the panic that ensued I mixed up even those things that I already knew. And now the head professor of my department thinks I'm a dumb failure. Even the topics I read I mix them up in the exams I can't retain numerical values and I mix up the management algorithms. Instead I waste whole of my time obsessing over emotions, useless people, daydreaming about the future, looking back at the past I just can't get a grip on my present and in that process I'm ruining my future. I want to stop obsessing over people and emotions and trivial materialistic stuff I just want to forget everything else and just fcking study and give one exam where I'm not grasping at straws for survival and feeling like my brain has turned to mush. I just want to study and forget about everything. Help me please, please."
"
So I’m working on losing weight with CICO but in the meantime, im a fat ugly lesbian. I’d kill to be straight but I’m not and that’s life.

My issue is that I hate thin women. The only women I like are fellow fat lesbians and I BARELY like them. I pretty much only sexually like butch/masc women but again... barely.

I hate thin women (gay or straight) on like another level. I think I’m incredibly jealous of how easy they have it (don’t argue with me on this one blah blah blah we’re all fighting our own demons, but statically, they’ve got it better. Fact. I’ve got be able to handle this without being in denial).

How do I deal with this? How does one get past jealousy? I’m basically a gay “pick-me”, so deeply do I dislike most women, even though I don’t want men to pick me at all! It’s stupid, it’s not like I’m trying to get women to pick me, we’re not even going after the same people! I go on dates, things are fine.There’s no logic to me being like this!!!

I just find thin women vapid, whiney, uptight, prissy, and just dumb. I think they’re oblivious to how easy they have it. I don’t view the lesbian ones as really lesbians unless they’re masc tbh and I see them as intruders??? I hate seeing them in queer spaces.

But they’re inevitably part of groups I’m in, whether at work or with friends or whatever. And I resent them for being around me, like they’re in my personal space, even when they’re not. I used to be nice to them but in the last year or so, I’m not nice at all. Lately, I make it clear as appropriately as possible that I don’t want them near me. And I don’t like being this unwelcoming, jealous, ugly person. I’m not like this with other people.

I’m not trying to be best friends, but how do I get over jealousy and just feel neutral towards them??? This can’t be healthy and I’m sure there’s internalized misogyny or something in there. I also have a history of being bullied by women for my appearance, including physical bullying. I’ve been hit and they’ve also grabbed my breasts and ass and stuff when I was in high school."
"

So i matched with a girl on Tinder and from the very start, didn’t really take much intiative. She texted me first, kept the convo going and asked for my snap... after a few days actually having ok convos she asked if she could Call me. We’d a 1+ hr talk until i wanted to sleep.

She actually seems very nice, but i’m just not in a place where i feel like i could take out time to date, yet i want to. I’m so stressed with exams rn and she wanna have phone calls 24/7 and i just told her i really can’t...

Idk if i should just tell her know i think she want something else or continue? She Seem way more invested in this than me and i honestly can’t provide me rn, even though i’d like to. 

She seems to be - not frustrated - but she hate the amount of time i’m using studying instead of meeting/ talking with her lol. Advice?"

"I was “downloading” a few OF megas last year this is honestly cause I keep seeing in comments “don’t make an OF people save that stuff in megas” and I’m like I doubt that so I opened some to check. Low and behold they do! 
Anyways I’m scared because recently someone told me they’d never download or open a mega cause people share malicious things in there like cp... now I’m scared. I didn’t see it it wasn’t supposed to be for that it was just supposed to be for only fans... and I didn’t even view every image or vid in it... but idek what could’ve been in there it was just a link off a Reddit sub!!! 
I put downloading in “” because if I downloaded it on my iPhone wouldn’t it be in the files app? I can’t find it there so I don’t think I downloaded it. Idk what I did I just clicked the link it said get the app to see this or something like that I got the app I opened it saw it for like 3 mins and just left and it looked normal I thought it was just OF stuff and I’m like wow they really do save it that’s crazy and then I just left !! Idk what else could’ve been in it cause I didn’t even check it all I’m so scared now."
"So I’ve been in a relationship for almost 4 years now and I am heading off to dorm nearly 7 hours away while my girlfriend stays and studies in our hometown. The problem is I love my girlfriend but I know I still have really deep feelings for someone else I have known since 2013. The girls I’ve known since 2013 (will refer to her as girl b to make it simple) was honestly the first girl I fell in love with  but as much I tried I was to nervous to tell her how I felt even though it was very obvious. We went to different high school and I decided to unfollow her on social media to try to get her off my mind but she never went away as I think of her everyday. As high school progressed opportunities came with different girls to have fun and even though I was interested I never wanted to use a girl it just felt wrong. So I decided a girl friend is what I need. In doing so I decided to start talking to a girl I knew had a crush on me and although I didn’t think she was perfect I decided that maybe if I took a chance in her I’d forget about girl B. But I knew in the back of my head when we started dating that I didn’t like her like I liked girl B but I thought with time I would start to have deeper feelings for her and in a way I was right but I also decided to break up with her. A couple days into the break up we got back together because I knew she genuinely loved me and I needed someone because I always felt alone. In the span of 3 years we grew so much together as I helped her embrace her voice and get out of her bubble and she did the same for me. Meanwhile girl b was always in my head, I could not go a day without thinking of her. Girl b and I were best friends but it always seemed like there was but more going some days and some day there was less. After got promoted to high school we didn’t really talk much and maybe that’s why I thought I could get her out of my head by unfollowing her but I guess I really hurt her although  she was the One that stopped texting as much; as we used to text almost every minute. I get that hurt her I just didn’t realize it at the time and I thought she didn’t care about me that much. She kinda grew to hate me but she also recently reached out to me after seeing me at a football game last year my heart dropped as girl b sat 3 row behind my girlfriend and I as my friend texted me saying that girl b wanted to talk but I had left to eat in n out with a friend because I knew she wanted to talk about the past. It even went so far that my friend took girl b to my house and demanded that I come out but I was eating at in n out they called my phone relentlessly as it made me lose my appetite due to how nervous I was towards confronting girl b. I decided to text girl b the next day and we both apologized and she said she just wants it all behind us now but I didn’t say everything I wanted to say. I’m now stuck with the decision of what to do. Do I tell my girlfriend everything and risk someone I have learned to love and lose the 4 years we’ve spent together? Do I tell girl b the truth and that I love her and I that I always have even though I’m pretty sure she no longer has feelings for me ? I’m going to be dorming 7 hours away from both of them do I just start my life over?"
"Well I apologize if its long to read 

I had an indecent experience of being followed by a car and something felt off about so I trusted my instincts and went somewhere besides my home it took about a while  for me to run and hide in stores and finally manage to call my faimly  but unfortunately none answered. I was stuck  and began to try to calm down but I couldn't help but get nervous and afraid for my life as the car was waiting outside  the  store.  Hopefully the store manager and the spouse  gave me a ride home , they saw me distressed and I knew them and they helped me I cant thank them enough. I got home my knees where  wobbly and I fell.  I dont know why but I dont feel safe anymore, I lock windows and doors and walk the opposite of traffic and never fell true safty unless I'm accompanied.  And I fucking hate it how do i get over this feeling I want to be calmer and not overthinking of bad situations all the time  when I try to sleep. I dont know why this is effecting me as I'm glad I acted quick and made it home safely.  I dislike this and want to learn to be able to feel safe and shit. Any advise would be helpful,sorry for the long text but thanks for reading it"
"So I don't dislike my friends, I've enjoyed hanging out with them until the past year. Maybe after quarantine was over, (I'm in NZ) people got a lot more attached to their phones?
I like to be present when I'm catching up with someone, and I keep my phone away unless I get a call. I have a couple friends who don't do this. Examples: I was invited to a games night by some friends. When I got there, we said hi, had a chat for a few minutes. Then they get out their phones and start scrolling through social media (tiktok, Facebook) and I kept asking when we were going to play, but they shrugged me off and I sat there for 10 minutes while they scrolled. I know 10 minutes might not seem long, but I didn't have anything to do, I just sat there waiting! And when we did end up playing some board games- they would keep texting, checking Facebook, watching Instagram stories and getting distracted the whole time. I felt so crappy afterwards because it seemed like they didn't appreciate me, or my time.
This week: I caught up with a different friend I hadn't seen in a while for a ""movie night"". And I was really excited because I was showing them one of my favourite movies. But I don't think they watched the movie at all. I would hear them laughing, and I looked over to laugh with them at something that happened in the movie- but they were messaging someone. And playing tiktoks outloud at some points. Their phone never even left their hand apart from when they went to the bathroom.

I feel like a grumpy old person when I complain about people being on their phones (I'm 22f) but I just feel so disrespected when people INVITE me over and then choose their phone over spending quality time with me.

So those friends have asked me to hang out again, and I said I was busy (I'm never busy). I don't know how to tell them I don't like hanging out with them because it's just not fun anymore. Should I send them a random message? Talk to them irl? I avoid conflict as much as I can, and I hate having serious talks, so I've been avoiding it. 

I was thinking maybe I would hang out with them again, and when they keep going on their phones, I'll be more straightforward that it's kinda rude. Like, you asked me to catch up but I feel like you're busy enough talking to other people/watching tiktoks?

TL/DR: my friends ignore me because they're too busy on their phones, and idk how to tell them it sucks."
"(Throwaway bc siblings follow real account)

My grades have been going downhill for over a year and I don’t know how to stop it. I've been struggling with anxiety for a few years now but it's gotten worse over the last year. Everytime I try to study or am taking a test I get a panic attack and am not able to think straight anymore. In most cases I then just stop or give up. 

I'm going to uni next year, and the course I want to take is pretty difficult, but I know I'm smart enough to be able to handle it. However if I keep having panic attacks there's no way I'm ever going to pass the exams, and feel like my only dream is getting ruined. 

Then there's also the fact that things I used to enjoy, don't bring any joy anymore. When I try something new, I usually give up after an hour or so. Even meeting up with friends comes with a lot of anxiety and more and more often I cry myself to sleep at night after having a breakdown. 

I feel like I'm just self sabotaging myself, or looking for excuses as to why I'm failing. I know I should probably see a therapist but that's currently not an option for me. There aren't really therapist close enough to were I live to be able to go there every week without my parents asking questions (I don't usually go out that much,) and I really don't want to do online settions. There's also the problem that I can't affors it, and even if I could I'm still under age, so my parents still have control over my bank account. 

Asking my parents about it, is also out of option. If I try to tell my dad (parents are divorced) about how I'm feeling very anxious, under a lot of stress, etc. he just keeps telling me that someone my age can't possibly feel that way and doesn't know what real stress is. Not to mention the fact that he talks about people who go to/ need therapy as if they're just weak and stupid. My mom would possibly understand but she's currently going though a lot already and I don’t want to burden her with it. Also, if she were to pay for it, all things that need to be paid for for me and my siblings, comes from my parents mutual childrens account, so I would need to talk to my dad about it anyway. 

There's a lot more to tell, and a lot more to the story, but I don't think going into detail right now is going to do anything other then making me have another breakdown.

I honestly just don't know what to do anymore. If any of you have general advice on how to deal with this, or ti what I should do, thay would be greatly appreciated."
"I really don’t enjoy talking unless it’s necessary or I have something to say. A lot of people find it either boring or offensive since they think I’m not interested in them. I don’t really wanna change, I just don’t understand why I feel this way. I’m just very reserved. I didn’t used to be this way until a few years ago. I just don’t really understand it."
"As in what are the responsibilities, chores, and things that are required for the job."
"Hi everyone, 

On the weekend I (F) had a bad shroom trip.   
It was at my first strong dose at my first  bush doof (small festival in the forest with no reception) and at night. Once the trip hit I started to feel overwhelmed and paranoid and wanting to be with my best friend (of 5 years, M).  When we found my best friend and another friend (M). I was so relieved but the other friend made a comment about me being codependent on my best friend. This made me uncomfortable because I didn't want to be a burden. I excused myself to go have a cry and my friends left me went back to the stage. After this point I could not find my friends at all and spent the whole trip alone by myself in the dark. Until 4hrs later when 2 friends found me at the campsite.   


One point during the night my best friend came back to the campsite but was only interested in finding the other friend (who made the codependency comment). He didn't ask me how I was and when I tried comforting him (since he was on lots of stimulants) he jerked away at my touch (which really hurt my feelings). The next morning, my best friend did not talk to me all morning, didn't say good morning, again didn't ask me if I was okay, he wouldn't even look at me. I told a few friends if someone could please talk to him and ask him to speak with me, right before he left he said how are you and then goodbye. This was our only conversation the whole festival, he had spent the rest of the festival with the friend who made the codependency comment.  


I spoke to another friend (F) who  advised that maybe I need to take a break from my best friend at least have a talk and figure out whats going on. I don't know if she knew more about what was going on, but she did have hang out with him during the festival.   
The codependency comment friend drove me home from the festival (just us two) and we had a big 3hr convo. He basically advised that I rely too much of my emotional support on my best friend and I basically need to stop and pretty much back off entirely, cut contact and take a break from him for a least a month +. The friend said he has a suspicion that my friend has wanted me to back off all year. I am in shock I has no idea my best friend felt this way and now I feel super in the dark like others know so much more about my friendship than I do. He says my best friend and I won't grow if we continue our friendship which makes me feel guilty. I thought that I would do this afterwards once our comedowns are over but the friend was saying it needs to be done asap while everything is still fresh or we will bitch out and stay friends or ""in limbo"".  
Worse part about this is that I know this friend will be relaying the same things to my best friend if he hasn't already.

During my bad shroom trip I realised that I was tired of always being on my own, losing friends and feeling disconnected from my current friends (which is okay because most of them are new friends I made the last year), wishing I was able to make new friends and I need to overcome that hurdle.   


So now I'm really confused on what I'll do and how I'll approach the convo with my best friend, that we've yet to have. If I stop being friends with my best friend I won't have anyone I'm close to (which comment friend knows). Which is the complete opposite of what I learned from my trip. I wanted to be less alone but everyone around me is telling the opposite I don't know what to do. 

Please advise how I should go about this and please keep and open mind about the drug use. We are both going through our comedowns this week so we will be both extra sensitive.

 (Also please understand that this isn't a situation where my best friend has a crush on me and can't continue his life with me because it's too hard that we're not together. I am certain of this, please don't mention it in your advice.)"
"A girl I had become good friends with last year has been saying negative things behind my back, basically that I don’t deserve the good things that have been happening to me and denouncing the clubs and organizations i’ve started. On top of that, I had told her I had a bad experience with a guy I was seeing and that I liked him but it unfortunately didn’t work. She sympathized and consoled me only to be dating him a few weeks later. 
I’m not sure what to do."
"Im half Lao, but I have never been fluent in Laotian. I just found an online class that can teach me Laotian but I am also interested in becoming more fluent in Spanish.

I look more hispanic than Lao since i’m mixed, so people often come up to me speaking Spanish and this motivates me to want to learn the language so I can communicate. Plus Spanish would be more useful in my career. 
Which should I learn first?"
"I don’t know if this is a good sub to do ask this or not but I have no idea how to get rid of these shoes. I bought these Yeezy WaveRunners off of a middle school friend a year ago but when he sent them, they were fakes. Really good fakes but still fake and I’m not into wearing fakes. I don’t wanna finesse someone like how dude did me either so I wanna give em to someone who actually wants them even though their replicas. Thought a bout throwing em away but thts like throwing the money I paid for in the trash. Guy blocked me and is in another state also so no contact. I guess I’m asking if any of y’all know where I could sell these shoes even if I’m not getting all my money back. Like is there a replica buying app or site. Like GOAT, StockX, Ebay, etc. but for replica sneakers?"
"In general, I get along with my extended family and my mother, but my dad and siblings are a whole thing to deal with. I'm coming to realize that my one sister is manipulative and emotionally abusive, and my father and I get along until he decides that sharing a fact and explaining why it is true, sharing an educated opinion, or not falling on my knees with thankfulness at everything I am given makes me an unthankful, rude child. I don't think this is justifiable, and I've considered going no contact, but I am not sure how I would manage to cut off only two people and whether or not this level of friction is reasonable for not speaking to people?"
"Almost 2 year ago a new person joined our workforce for a month and caused hella trouble for me. She would twist my words during each shift and complain about me bullying her due to how many employees would quit, leave, or be fired under my training management. After so much trouble that happened between us management decided one of would go if something happened again but she ended up quitting and finding a new job. Do to covid19 management ended up hiring her again and the last couple months have been hell. She does it every other week over dumb shit to the point management has called me into meetings for it at least 4 times. We had employee meetings at least twice since her return. I just want to do my job and get out without interacting her, but I notice she does things to get a rise out of me. If I'm talking to a customer she'll go talk to them after me like I did and pretend they've been bffs for a long time. If I'm doing something she wants to be right there in my ass to help. If it's something thats my job or I do she goes and does it. Management pretty much believes I'm the problem when I can't do or say anything without her twisting my words or actions. Recently they gave me a raise but I also think I'm going to be fired. She keeps saying things against me and even cried in front of management while I stood there hard faced. It's not easy to find a job so close to home but I'm starting to think its not worth it. I lost work hours and potential evenings off because she seems like the victim. I've told management I'm uncomfortable working with her due to the misunderstanding that happen and how I'm tired but it seems like quitting is the only choice. 

I know my options are stay or quit but any other help out there?"
"So for background me and my best friend are in college and we’ve been friends since freshman year of high school. We go to different colleges which are quite far and her parents are pretty strict about her driving so we don’t see each other too often unless it’s the holidays or Christmas. Anyways we were watching a movie the other night and she casually mentions that she was going on a trip out of the country with some of her family and before I was able to jokingly say something about me coming she said that maybe Sarah (not actually name) may come. Sarah has been her main friend in college and while Im obviously not upset that she’s making other friends in college bc so am I, I’m upset that she would pick her first to go on this trip, which is a place that she and I have talked about how cool it would be. If it would have been like literally any other place I don’t think that I would have been hurt as much. With that being said, we were planning on going on a road trip in a couple of weeks and to be honest, I wanna call it off. This isn’t just this incident but I feel that she has been more distant which I thought was more due to her being very busy. I just feel sick of prioritizing people who aren’t prioritizing me. I straight up told her that I wasn’t happy with that and left Bc it was fresh and I didn’t want to escalate the situation. But I am so hurt that she would choice this girl, who by the way they’ve already had a falling out in their 2 years of friendship over our 6 yr friendship. I know that I’m justified to feel hurt but I don’t know how to address the situation without making any rash choices. Any advice for how to deal with this would be appreciated."
"We started a small company together, but this friend just took advantage of me and slyly kicked me off the company's cofoundership. Now I have nothing to do with this company. While stopping work, this person wanted me to continue working as an employee which was totally not acceptable to me but they started getting rude and demanding.

I formed the college project group earlier with this person with whom am not on talking terms anymore.

The teachers are not helping me in changing the groups. One of them just straight away said ""Not possible"" and the other one is trying to convince me to work with the same project. This project is going to be 1 year long, and it has not even started yet.

Teachers just know that we had a fight, but they don't know what the reason is. They probably don't understand the entire situation and think its some child fight. What should I do to leave this group? Should I tell the actual reason so they are more understanding or will that be a bad move somehow?"
"i’m a poc i have 2 friends who i have known and been friends with basically since i was a year old. they are both white and are friends with an extreme racist that brags about hating the lgbtq+ community and poc. the last time they invited me over they waited until i was almost at his (my friends not the racists) house to tell me the racist person was coming to sleep over (at the time i had no idea he was racist i thought it was some random guy) then when i arrived at his house they told me to not to worry but the guy they invited over wanted to be apart of the kkk which made really uneasy and uncomfortable but they assured me that if he said anything racist towards me they would do something which just made me even more uncomfortable after a while the guy finally showed up and demanded they play (i stg i’m not lying) country music he then proceeded to play some of the most racist county music i’ve ever heard in my life and joked about jews during the holocaust and started saying homophobic slurs about his ex friend who had recently come out as gay and everything the racist said both my friends just agreed with and laughed even tho they told me before the racist ever showed up that they thought he was annoying and they disliked being friends with him and they couldn’t get rid of him so i grabbed my bag and told them i had to go feed my dog his meds (lie) and i left. they haven’t reached out or talked to me past that day besides sending me snaps i’m not sure if i’m just overreacting or something that just made me feel extremely betrayed and alone especially since i had been best friends with them since forever i just don’t know what to do 

ps: sorry for the horrible sentence structure and grammar i’m writing this before i change my mind and decide not to post it"
"So this comes with a little bit of a story.

I'm currently 22M, and my girlfriend is 24 and pregnant.

When I was 20, I was dating an extremely toxic girl whom I met when she was 5 months pregnant. I instantly had a crush on her and we started talking instantly. It was mostly over FB Messenger and snapchat. I was thrown off by the fact that some days she was super sweet to my, and literally over night she would ignore me, act like she hated me, and say she had a boyfriend now. It went back and forth switching every few days. 

When we became officially, she moved in rather quickly because her child had been born and she still lived with her parents. It's worth noting at this point that I lost my virginity to her so I became attached.

I worked graveyard at the time, and I still do. Come to find out that she cheated on me while I was at work almost every night with her Baby Daddy. I found out because he sent me screenshots mostly to taunt me. Like an idiot I let her stay and admitted it was my fault. We made up and it seemed fine until only a couple weeks after that when she started texting him using FB Messenger's secret mode(right next to me BTW) and snapchat. She did all of this blatantly and out in the open. She would claim it was just to maintain a healthy relationship with the guy for their daughter's sake. 

I started living in anxiety, stress, and just general unhappiness. I learned to look into every little thing to uncover the truth about it. Even something placed where it shouldn't be was a clue she had been cheating on me. Her not answering texts quickly enough was proof she was on the phone with him. It all added up and I was right. After a lot more of this life, I finally broke it off with her for good and started to heal. 

Right at the end of my healing process I met my current girlfriend of 1½ years. She's never been with anyone else and her family &amp; childhood friends have told me the same. I'm her first for literally everything. I love her a lot and she loves me back. But lately I've been suspicious she's cheating on me mostly because I'm experiencing the same minute signs. She's not answering texts instantly, I'm not with her at night because I still work graveyard, and she's pregnant, about 14 weeks if it matters. She's assured me multiple times and I believe her in my heart and my gut. But the toxic relationship I endured still seems to be taking its toll on my ability to trust anyone.

How can I help get over this? How can I learn to trust my S/O more so it doesn't become a burden on her??

TL;DR: I was in a toxic relationship and got chested on with the girl her took my virginity and now I think my current girlfriend is cheating on me even though I KNOW she's not"
"when i was younger my mom would get drunk and we would get into arguments and then she would say, “god just let me hit her one time”, “i’m gonna hit you”, “ungrateful child” “ungrateful bitch” etc. we got into a really big fight when i was 16 when i told her i was depressed and she didn’t believe me. now i’m 18, she still drinks, we haven’t gotten into a fight, but she’ll randomly tell me she loves me, but i don’t say it back because she never apologized for the way she acted and for the things she said. am i wrong for feeling this way? i can’t talk to her about my feelings because last time i did we got into a really bad argument, and my dad and sister never listen to me so i basically feel trapped. she’s trying to change i guess and i’m glad we don’t fight as much, but i still remember every word she said to me and how it made me feel"
The title. This was couple of years ago or  possibly 3. They seem to be attempting to be nice when we do talk although it isn’t regular and people can change (but I don’t know if he still says that type of things he used to) I just feel like it’s embarrassing to be friends with someone who bullied you.
"{RANT} She still denied cheating but I found messages on her phone in the past flirting with guys and she dumped me after I confronted her. Then we got back together a month later and I found another guy saying “I thought you wanted to date me at first but now I feel you dont” she was also deleting all my complements on her instagram photos so I messaged the guy and he said they never had sex and he also didn’t know we were together and she was talking about his dick in the car... next day after I found out I was blocked on everything with no explanation after a 3 year relationship... I really loved her so much and it sucks she didn’t love me for a long time I feel she did at first and I thought she would never do this to me. Im not sure if im looking for advice or what but I feel like im never going to have this type of love again (the actual love the first year and a half of being with her) ill never have something like that again. I’ve been drinking everyday and only eating dinner the past two weeks, and I stay up all night and get 2 hours of sleep my mind races."
"He’s my only friend 
He’s the only person who’s always there for
Me 
He’s the only person I can talk to when my siblings ignore me or my mom gets mad at me 
He does whatever I want 
He’s always there 
I don’t really have anyone else 
My mom is hot and cold and my family
Is just messy honestly and he’s the only
Support I have besides them 
Feeling this way scares me because the last time we broke up I was so low and broken I became a really intense self harmer and genuinely just wanted to die because of how alone I was I can’t really go through that again but I also don’t know what else to do besides staying and just trying to make things work"
"11:40, I got bad habits, any help with getting to bed earlier?"
