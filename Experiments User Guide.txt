If you wish to run the Experiments, please run the Experiments.py file.
The script will ask you which number of Experiment you want to run.
It expects to get one of these numbers as input:
1 / 2 / 3 / 0. 
0 - for running all the experiments.
For each Experiment, A csv  file with all the results will be created under The Results Directory.
The name of the file will be in this format - Experiment{numExperiment}-results-{current date}.csv
Each csv file will be in the following structure:
*The columns names will RD(Random Forest)/MLP/SVM/NB(Naive base).
*There will be also a column with the name 'title' that indicates the row's name. 
*Each row name will mention the preprocessing method and the kind of features that were used.
*Each cell contains the accuracy score for a triple combination- preprocessing method x featuers type(in the title) x Learning algorithm(in column).
*If the accuracy score for a cell is -1 it means that this combination was not tested during the experiment.

For Example, 
We can see in Experiment1-results-Oct-23-2021.csv that the first row is:

Title	                 RD       MLP       SVM			NB
BagOfWords-min preprocess	0.7525	0.81	0.7275000000000000	0.8

The meaning if this row is: 
*For the combo of minimal preprocess on documents + using Bag of words model + using Random forest we got accuracy of 0.7525.

For the combo of minimal preprocess on documents + using Bag of words model + using MLP we got accuracy of 0.81.

*For the combo of minimal preprocess on documents + using Bag of words model + using SVM we got accuracy of 0.7275.

*For the combo of minimal preprocess on documents + using Bag of words model + using nb we got accuracy of 0.8.
