3,"My new book is available on Amazon. I would like to share my story of how I overcame, what I went through in hope that it will be someone else’ SURVIVAL GUIDE.It started out with Mr. Prince Charming for the first 6months and gradually changed into Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde. This book is based on a true story about a powerful and explosive relationship! It contains graphic scenes of sex, drugs, violence and abuse. This book was written mostly from my journals. At first it was because I didn’t want to forget all the good. Later it was to protect my sanity. My abuser was extremely manipulating and kept me confused much of the time with mixed signals. (GASLIGHTING). Until now I had always believed that love endures all. I honestly thought my love would be the love that saved him. I honestly thought my love would be enough to change him. I thought that if I prayed enough, God would make him safe for me.",0
4,I (f19) just broke up with my boyfriend (m22) of two years after I found he made a tinder profile recently. I looked at the profile and conversations really never got past the introductions but I couldn’t take it. I really do love him and want the rest of my life with him and he wants the same but I can’t trust him right now so I broke it off. I said there’s nothing he can do right now but haven’t completely closed the door on getting back one day down the line. What would you do if it was someone you truly loved?,0
5,My boyfriend and I have been together for just over a year. We have been having quite a few minor arguments recently. We had the chat yesterday about the best way to go forward. He wanted to go on a break for a couple of weeks to see if he misses me. We work in the same company so how do I act to get him to want to come back to me and is it likely when a guy initiates the break that he will come back?,0
6,"Hi Everyone, I am new member here. This is not about me or my marriage, but this is about my Friend who lives in South Carolina and who is suffering from an emotional abuse by her husband for years now. Is there anyone who knows an agency that I can contact or a support group in that area to contact and report this abuse? My friend doesn't have access to a phone or internet all the time. She only contacts me when she can because her husband is very controlling. Besides, her husband did not paid their phone bills last month and their phone was disconnected. I don't know what to do as well. I want to help her, but I am too far away from her. All I can do is to report it to the right agency of domestic/emotional abused. Please I need some advice and if anyone is from Jacksonville, SC here. Thank you.",1
7,"I keep trying to break off a friend who insists he wants to turn back time to what we used to be and insists on being friends, also exaggerates that he did a lot for me and it makes me really uncomfortable that he cannot just understand i dont want him in my life/i want to be alone. He keeps blaming himself when its not really his fault and i just want him to break it off with me because i just want to be alone. How can i convey this without making him feel he was at fault and make him realize its normal to feel like you want to break off friendships? Any advice would be welcome, thanks",0
8,"3 years ago today he whiplashes & strangled me in front of my children and his youngest child. 4 children witnessed the abuse. I had escaped 10 years of abuse when I finally realized it was a life or death situation. I slowly started towards the light. I’ve come so far & still have quite a journey ahead. 3 surgeries, fusions, yes that monster caused severe issues in my spine. I’m now fused in my C6-7 and my Si joints. Pharmaceuticals were his weapon to aid in destroying me. Tearing me down every day. I gave up and gave in. I was completely numb. 
3 years ago today, I decided to take my life back. To go within and heal. I decided to face my demons and be kind to those parts of me that needed intense love and understanding. I needed to nurture myself. Choosing this path has not been easy…but it’s been worth i",0
9,"Exactly what the title says. We went out for ice cream after a movie and it turns out he really didn’t wanna go. I had no idea as he didn’t voice this until later. He said I forced him to come and it upset me and I was hella confused. 
It ended with him telling me that it’s just something guys do. 
Things that they don’t wanna do to make the girlfriend happy. 
How do I proceed knowing this info? It’s never come up in 2 years. I’d have no idea he doesn’t wanna do things.. he plays everything as if he wants to do it.",0
10,"I was almost killed last year by my ex, 5 staples in my head. There were ATLEAST 3 people in my life who told me I got what I deserve and hopefully next time he will finish the job! I remember feeling soooo angry and hurt! I let it cause a reaction in me that they were able to feed off of. Point of me telling you this is that there will always be people who use your trauma to manipulate or control you by saying things that make you relive those experiences so that they can hold you in the same emotional space you were when you were with him. The reason they do that is because THEY are weak and abusive and want to take over where he left off. DO NOT ALLO THIS! You left hin for a reason, that was a huge step in a positive direction and dont allow ANYONE, even family, to try to take that victory or that healing away from you! The best way to respond, is not to! You DID NOT deserve it, no matter what!! And it is time to heal that beautiful battered heart of yours! Stay strong!!",0
11,I am so scared. Left my abuser a week ago and he was pounding on my doors at 1:30 this morning. My son forgot to lock the back door and he walked in very drunk!! Luckily I was in the back of my house and was able to push him outside and lock the door. He eventually left but I'm terrified of him,1
12,"Reddit, I’m a fairly successful woman in my early 30s and have quite a few friends and interests. But I’m consumed by regret and can’t break out of my obsessive, cyclical thought patterns.

Despite being fairly academic, I was really badly bullied at school and didn’t live up to my full potential. When it came to choosing a university, I ended up going to an ugly, unimpressive uni, the sort that people pull a face about whenever I begrudgingly admit I went there. 

By this point I had really bad mental health problems and ended up having some big fall outs. I ended my time at university completely miserable, friendless and filled with regret. 

My early twenties were a complete mess and centred around an unhealthy relationship. I got fired from loads of jobs, a memory which still makes me feel really anxious and insecure. I also made some stupid decisions, eg getting into debt, following said boyfriend to another country where I studied for a masters in a subject that was more him than me. 

When I returned, I started to get help, taking antidepressants and having counselling. I also started to get more relevant work experience and training and, at 26, finally landed a decent job in field relevant to my interests. Life has felt more solid since, but I feel very behind in many ways. I have also recently had to move back to my parents’ house because I was living in an unsafe flat-share and don’t earn enough to live alone. This situation has has knocked my confidence considerably.

I hope to move out again soon, and am grateful to have a place to go, but this isn’t how I saw myself at this age. I always longed to live somewhere far away from the place I grew up. I didn’t expect to be wealthy, but I thought I’d at least earn enough to rent a studio flat in a suitable area.

My life is okay on the surface, and I don’t want to sound ungrateful. But underneath I’m a broken mess, and constantly feel inadequate. I so wish I’d done better at school and gone on to study at a prestigious university. I wish I’d made solid friendships during those lost years. I wish my career had kicked off earlier so I could have travelled more and had a wider range of experiences.

I just keep thinking about all the time I’ve wasted over the years, time spent crying in bed or being too scared to leave the house. I get flashbacks all the time to when I would behave in a ‘crazy’, paranoid way when I was young and feel so humiliated. 

Every single day I wish I could go back in time and redo my life, lay a more solid foundation for the years ahead. Get help sooner so I could have made the most out of my youth. 

My discomfort is so strong that I find myself not wanting to have children because I feel like I am not ‘enough’. I feel permanently ‘stained’ by my past if that makes sense, and still bear very real reminders in terms of the amount of debt I’m still in.

How do I just accept myself as I am and move forward? I’ve tried counselling and CBT and nothing seems to work. I also don’t want to go back on anti-depressants.",0

21,"Hi. So I have PTSD already from domestic violence and multiple childhood rape. On the 15th, my boyfriend of like 4 years got black out drunk. I tried to sit down next to him laying down on the couch. He kicked me. So hard I flew. He made this angry face and kicked me in the pelvis. I almost went threw out coffee table. I screamed so loud that he grabbed me before my body crashed into the coffee table. I would have been seriously hurt. I was injured where my spine and pelvis meet. I just laid down after because within seconds he was snoring on the couch after this. I just cried thinking about all the times my rapist ex used to literally throw me up into the air over the steps and catch me by my neck and clothes and say things like he could throw me up and let me call down and no one would deny I just tripped or jumped to suicide.",1

26,"I have a sincere questions. Why many domestic abuser seems to kill themselves after the abused leaves them (of course its not easy to leave, they are emotional and mentally unstable, both loving and hating very soon or alternatively,  so after several attempts one can leave). Keep in mind the abused also goes through violent phases by the abuser where the victim/abused could also have been killed. So we see a pattern of toxic behavior by the abuser. They are not good at emotional attachment or balance or anger management. But do they fall in deep depression after their loved one leaves finally? I am all for leaving for the support of the abused, but how can a society help an abuser get rid of his or her toxic pattern of living so they can also live, like a fully functional adult.",0

I have been making plans to leave since that day. Unfortunately my elderly father lived with us and that created a mess with my siblings calling elderly services and my brother eventually removed him from my home. 
I’ll post some pictures in the comments. I never thought he would ever go this far. I don’t sleep. I am on anti depressives anti anxiety meds. 
He seriously just came home from his doctor with a script for Xanax and told me he got them for me.

32,"Hi, I need some help with something that is killing me. I'm a 19 year old m who's been in a relationship with my girlfriend for the past 3 years. I've always known she's had these mental illnesses (depression, severe anxiety, ptsd, body dysmorphia) as well as being undiagnosed autistic ever since I met her, however she was on a track to being able to manage these mental illnesses better and not let them get the better of her, and I was helping to build her confidence and have the ability to live as normal a life as she can.

For backstory, before COVID she used to struggle with catching public transport, to which I helped her catch her first ever train into the local town centre, she struggled with eating in public restaurants, to which I brought her to a quiet restaurant for one of our first dates to help her get more comfortable. I was so in love with her and I was happy to see that she wanted to make an effort for me, she wanted to live a normal life with the person she loved.

When COVID hit and we went into lockdown, she started to become much more worse with her mental health. I was furloughed, and in order to keep her company whilst we weren't allowed to mix with households, I decided to move in with her. We spent the first 2 months happy we could spend all of our time together and not be apart, we baked and watched movies, played animal crossing together and I introduced her to Star Wars etc. Life was going well, but being in a lockdown for 6 months doing nothing had an impact on her. 

She then started having issues with her space around her, saying she made drastic changes for me and that she doesn't have anything of her own. I did what I could and moved my stuff into a spare room so she could decorate and rejig her bedroom. She became scared to leave the house on her own, and couldn't even put a toe out the front door without having a breakdown. She began self harming again and waking me up at 3am to let me know what she's done. She became so mentally ill that she has to claim benefits as her mental illnesses stop her from being able to work, and these benefits limit what we as a couple are able to do once we're legally joined together. Even if there was nothing wrong with me, my income per month cannot exceed £2000 a year, otherwise she can't get the benefits to support her.

We had to get her started on medication, and she was becoming better on it. The doctors however ceased all contact with her and didn't prescribe her with more meds, causing her to have major withdrawal symptoms and she ended up slicing her leg so deep that we had to call an ambulance. 

I think I may have PTSD from that day, as now I'm scared that she is going to eventually do something similar or kill herself. I spent more time in the past year being scared and worried, making changes in my life to make sure she doesn't kill herself. I'm scared to even be away from her at my new office job in fear that she's going to slit her wrists, or take too many pills. I've become exhausted, depressed, anxious and I've regained my old anger issues, I'm now addicted to nicotine because the smoking helps me with the stress. I think I am not in love with her anymore, but I still care about her deeply.

Just last night, she woke me up at 3:30am to say ""I want to break up"". I asked her why and she said ""You'll have a better life without me, I'm ruining your chances at having a normal life."". She kept telling me how I'm going to resent her at 40 years old and blame her on the fact that I never had a normal life. She said that she is eventually going to kill herself and doesn't think it's fair that I have to deal with taking care of her and missing out on finding out what my life could be like whilst I'm still young. 

I don't want to be the person who left a suicidal girl at the moment before she killed herself. I don't want to be responsible for causing her family a lifetime of sadness by not being there for her. I'm so terrified that if I leave and try to help myself, that she will end her life. She's not trying to emotionally blackmail me into anything, I know her and I know that she would do anything to protect me. But I can't accept the fact that she wants me to leave so I can be happy and she can die alone. 

Please help me.",0

37,"I have had one of the worst experiences in relationships, always obsessing over people. This girl I met about in March-April, she's just...so good. She's exactly the logician I would want, the person who respects everyone, someone who's patient and understands my traumas. 
I feel something's different, I don't know what love is but with her I feel like I'm at home, it's exactly that kinda comfort. I don't obsess over her, I think. It's not the clingy/sticky situation where you wanna text someone all the time, it's more of a sense of freedom, even when the conversation dies out, it's not an awkward silence, it's more of a comfortable silence. It feels comfortable to have her around, and if we drift apart, it's not like everything's tearing apart, but I just pray for things to get back to normal as soon as possible and there's a slight discomfort..like when your heart feels heavy just before an interview? Kind of that.

I don't know what the future holds but I hope this turns to something beautiful and very stable. I think I love her, I've never really felt love so I don't know what it's like..but I'm happy and comfortable with someone so much, for the first time. Being with her, I almost got over all my insecurities, traumas, past fears and..found a love for myself as well that I never knew existed. It's just so motivating.

This is not what I want for myself, I just don’t know what else to do",1
45,I feel so sorry for my current date i think i should just break up with him. I think i am incapable of love,0
46,"It’s a mess and hiding all of this is very hard, I want to come clean and feeling like I’m committing a crime for being in love with a woman. 

My parents are pretty religious but my mom is lowkey gay and doesn’t know it/want to admit it because she loves god too much. Her and my dad are divorced but are on good terms so I can tell them together at once but how.... I’ve been trying to tell them but the words won’t come out. 

In 5 months we’re going to move in together. 

My last relationship last 4 years and it was with a boy, it was first relationship ever too and he was so toxic and abusive to me and it was impossible to break up but once I did it I found myself super attracted to woman and I have no sexual feelings towards men whatsoever.",0
47,It’s been 4 months since I left my three year on and off abusive relationship. I lost my baby at 21 weeks pregnant on January 28th from all the abuse and that was the last straw for me. I left a month later on February 28th. A blessing in disguise as much as the trauma from that has hurt me almost daily. But I’m finding myself again. I’m working crazy hours and rebuilding everything that was broken and taken from me. I am healing. I am growing. I am learning. Feels so good to finally be rid of that toxic evil demon! I know my worth finally. I deserve so much more than to be beaten and talked down upon everyday. I can’t even imagine ever letting anyone treat me like that again. This group has helped me so much so thank you ladies,0
48,Ladies my new man is amazing he worked 10 hours today and still stopped and got me flowers in his way home.  trust me ladies we deserve better then what we went thru. We all can find happiness,0
49,"Many many years later, everything is worse and I feel played as fuck. Tricked and deceived by the system. Wtf I was thinking? I knew in my gut that the situation was hopeless (not attractive), but for some retarded reason I decided to keep going... I should have trusted my gut since back then. Fuck people, and fuck society

PS: being smart educated and skilled wont save you. Being fit wont save you. Having money wont save you. And even working hard, wont save you. So yeah fuck all",0
50,I had zoom meeting for court with my x abuser....seeing him hearing his voice.....made my survive mode kick in...can't sleep...my heart is racing...I haven't slept sound....nitemares every nite....he's states apart yet....just his voice sent me rite back to where it all began....so many memories...so much pain....I feel like I'm dying every nite wake gasping for air....God help me please...,1
51,I recently broke up with my boyfriend and i feel horrible. I messed up really bad and i keep thinking back to how i could of done things differently and what i should of done differently too. I keep randomly remembering all the things we did together and the time we spent with each other. It hurts like crazy and i always think about the past decisions i made and what i should of ended up doing but didn’t. Its eating me up inside and i miss them so much but i also just wanna forget about them. Idk what to do about it.,0
52,"I wanted to suggest a really good book I am reading called ""Why does he do that? In the minds of angry and controlling men"" by Lundy Bancroft. I don't know if it has been suggested here before but it is one of the best books on abusers and how to help yourself that I have read so far",0
53,"I have a stalker. He's my ex now. He kept asking me to meet up with him and I kept refusing. Finally he said he would show up to my house where my kids were if I didn't meet him somewhere else. I met up with him at a gas station and he just kept trying to tell me how much he loves me he sorry he is how badly he wants everything to work out. He pulled me out of my car and tried to force me in the backseat of his car. Then he got mad and choked me and told me if i made a scene he'd kill me before the cops got there. He finally let go and went around to my car and got my purse and phone out. He told me to give him all my money and he'll leave me alone forever and when I refused to own my phone he broke it and threw it. The was monday. Since then he's sent someone to my job to send the message that he said ""hey"" because he knows he's not allowed there anymore and hes messaged a friend about me. I'm so tired of this. Everyone I tell about the situation keeps telling me it's my own fault for meeting him but he literally shows up wherever I am. He doesn't care. I feel like he's going to end up killing me.",1
54,"I don't know what to do, I feel lost. 

My partner and I are in a long distance relationship and I really do love him so much. I'm just struggling hard to stay positive for us to close the distance; Every option involves some criteria that doesn't apply to us, and I honestly just feel hopeless.
The other option is getting married soon, but I've told him I don't feel ready for that (mentally I need to mature more).

Its getting too much to handle and I need advice- should I persuit the relationship or leave now?",0
55,"I broke up with my bf today. I’ve been with this guy one and off for a little over a year and he’s so sweet and attentive. However, He was verbal abusive when he’s drunk and I left him. I gave him a second chance once he got clean. Everything was going great for the last 5 months. I were happy and  we were planning to get married next year. The last month, he drank whiskey once per week and he mostly just got silly drunk. However, yesterday night, he got abusive and threw me against the wall, dragged me out of his house at 11:00pm and locked me out in the cold. I was haft naked, no shoes and nothing on me. I ran to a neighbor’s house and had them called the cops for me. He told the cop I attacked him and he needed to defend himself. The cop said that they can not arrest him and helped me packed. We were not living together so I still have a place to live. When I talked to him this morning, I realize he is an abuser drunk or not. I can’t believe I’m so stupid for not realizing it. It’s not the alcohol, it’s the person. I just need some emotional support to affirm my decision to leave is right and to keep me from being tricked again.",1
56,"I've been seeing a therapist for the last several months and I'm trying to get away from my mentally ill parents. For context, I'm a 21 (F) and my dad has severe PTSD and is controlling, and physically and emotionally abusive.

57,"I’m scared, like really scared. Last night he flipped out on me after I went to sleep. He has never in 11 years ever woke me up to yell at me. He called me a slut a cunt a whore told me I was heartless that I’m using him for his money (every time I’ve tried to work he has threatened to leave while watching HIS kids). Then he told me if I wasn’t gonna give him sex he was going to cheat on me. Then he started Slamming doors and throwing shit and hitting furniture, his dresser is busted beyond repair 
He’s never gotten this out of control before, I think he knows somethings up or off and I’m so worried he’s gonna do something irreversible.

I always reply, but it starts to affect me, and I get really upset and start crying while I’m at work. I feel like if I don’t answer it’s going to get worse. Should I just be ignoring all his messages? Or is that unsafe to do so?",1
61,"am I being over dramatic or are my parents actually are so controlling?

So I’m a 17 year old muslim female. My parents don’t let me wear pants I have to wear a long skirt because men are attracted to legs. I can’t talk to a boy if he isn’t my teacher or law related. I can’t have any form of social media. I can’t post my face on social media either or I will get hit badly. I can’t ride a bike until after I’m married because a bike is known to break women’s hymen’s same goes for riding a horse.

I can’t show my voice to social media, I can’t even post a picture of my hand. I’m not allowed to move out until I’m married. 

If I say I don’t want kids they say “it’s not your choice, you have to have children” they put me up to such high standards. I still have to ask them if I can go out with my friends even if I turn 30",0

But the thing is our texts have been a little weird and dry since 2 nights ago and I haven't heard from her today. I want to go for the evening but I'm not sure if should stay the night. Should I just tell her now that I can't stay the night for my plans next day, or should I go with intentions to stay but if the vibe didn't feel right make an excuse and leave?? What would my excuse be ?(I can't fake a family emergency and I feel like pretending to be sick would seem fake or they freak out too much cause of covid). Or is this all my anxiety convincing me everyone hates me?",0
65,"After not hearing from my ex for over a year, because he was in prison and then actually following parole, he’s contacting me again.

Texting, calling, leaving voice messages, with veiled threats and accusations. Every couple months I run in to him or randomly see him on the side of the rode I’m driving. I was told it was a) either my imagination or b) coincidence. Well, now I have proof from the escalating phone calls. 

I’m going to report him today. It’s just never easy. You think it’s done and it’s never over. So, I’m working up the courage to contact the police and let them know and then go through the court processes all over again.

We can eat vegetables again he hated veggies I made them as a side he'd get mad and throw them he would only eat fries and meat if it was on pizza I made the kids he'd throw it in the trash. We can all eat anything we want now without the worry I even had a little satisfaction deleting his precious mt dew from my favorites that I so many times had to get instead of something I or the kids needed.

I just feel like crap though and I feel like I should break up with him. I’m not good enough for him. And he shouldn’t have to take care of me. I just feel like at this point I’m going to actually go down this road and a very irrational part of me feels like breaking up with him and burning bridges will make my death easier for people.  I’m not as suicidal before. It’s been coming and going a lot lately but I still think he shouldn’t have to support me mentally and emotionally. It must be exhausting for him.",0
70,"Some time ago I've realized that everything is pointless. Not in a nihilistic way, but more of just and open-minded realization. I've realized that everything is just a construct made by society and everything we were ever taught to strive for is actually pointless and empty.

Success is a very subjective idea but it seems like society keeps pushing a singular picture of it to keep everyone in check. Fame is an extremely abstract idea that I personally never understood. Money is well, a material item that get thrown around and as the saying goes, ""Money can't buy you happiness"" and I've experienced what it meant way too many times. Then my last hope which is people in general, like friends, connections, relationships and perhaps love has been shattered after being backstabbed, betrayed, abandoned, left behind and etc.

Being a former avid dreamer this realization of reality has shattered me and has left me as a shell of my former self. Every time I try to strive for a passion I have or something I would go ""Why am I doing this? It's just a waste of time. I can't get rich off of this and fame and influence is a lie so why bother."" or like ""Why am I chasing ""success"" I should just stay low and humble. Nobody cares about what I do."" and etc. 

It also ruined because well, I kinda wanted all that. I was a loser growing up. My entire pre-school and elementary years had me being the butt of every joke and I was always overlooked and underestimated. I was always the one that every one knows would suck in a performance task like let's say a dance routine or something. No matter what I tried to redeem myself always gets shot down and they magnify my flaws. Then when I got out of my shell in high school people just judged me and called me a narcissistic attention seeker or whatever which hurt me even more. All that has given me the drive and motivation to rise and seek great success in life. So when I realized how pointless and empty they actually are, every thing fell apart for me and I have been stagnant for years.

I have a lot of passions and fire in me, but after all I've been through I just couldn't follow up on my them anymore.",0

72,I am a adult child of DV. I was abused in every way you could abuse a daughter. Scared to death as a child. The breaking point or my proof was my sister being there when he was trying to physically force my to the bedroom. She and I fought so hard that night. I guess he realized there was someone else there and I now had proof so could expose him. He just let go and left the house. I ran away that night to my mothers. That was  situation of alcoholism and domestic abuse but not directed at me. After 3 years of all I could stand I ran away and married the first of 3 times and dealt with DV.

It’s been months since now she texted me outta nowhere, at first she was like “what’s up with you?” And then told me how she felt bad for how she was with me and that she was just very busy and stressed with work and took it out on me.

While you? You will grow. You will make it through this and thrive. You will rise above them and prove to them that you are too strong for them to push down. You will show them how amazing and beautiful you truly are.",0
81,"Hi guys, this is something that I've been wondering about. Something that is really common in abusive relationships is that you never get the closure that you want about it being abuse and the person in the relationship never admits that they deliberately hurt you over and over again, which is even more emotional abuse for the person to deal with. But then I'm confused about this because I've also read about how narcissists 'hoover' their victims, which can often involve them admitting all the bad things they've done and apologising to manipulate their victim into staying with them and thinking they've changed. So which is it? Do narcissists/abusers admit to their abuse or do they not?",0

90,"The person you are now and and the person you were when you broke up with me is not the same person that I fell in love with. I've heard many people say that the military changes you and makes you see life  differently. And I do believe it's true to some extent. But I don't think this applies to you especially since your job in the military isn't on the front line. You just started showing your true colors. You left me feeling worthless and made me feel like I was never gonna be enough for anyone. You made me feel like I will always be replaceable when I found out you got into a new relationship just a few months after you ended our relationship. 

I noticed that you have never really loved yourself and you seek validation from others. You might think (and I also thought this for a while) that you are doing way better than me because you are in a new relationship and because you are doing better financially than me at the moment. 

But no, I knew that was false. You can have all the money in the world and have all the relationships/hook ups you want, but we both know that money can't buy happiness and as long as you continue to seek validation from others, you will be in an endless cycle of misery. I know I may not have a lot of money and I'm still single (and I think I will be for a while as I'm not desperate to be in a relationship and because I'm very anti social), but I know I never have to seek validation for others because I have always loved myself for who I am.

Now I know that it's not that I was never enough for you, you just never appreciated anything that I've done for you. Because of how I much I missed you, I was tempted to get into the casual dating/hook up scene to fill this void but I resisted because I'm strong and that lead me to know my worth. And I'm no longer gonna let anyone determine my worth for me.

You might say that you're too busy working on yourself to notice if I'm doing better, but we know that's false. We both had to work on ourselves and rushing into a new relationship leaves no room or time to work on self improvement. Im not saying you are the only reason that lead our relationship to failure because I know we both did mistakes. But I actually have the integrity to work on my faults and mistakes because I know that's the right thing to do unlike you. 

Ever since I've been working on myself, I finally knew what exactly are my morals and values. And I realized we don't have the same ones and they're not even close to being similar. I'm glad you put me through all this because it has made me a better person. Ever since you ended things between us, I was hoping that we will eventually date again. But now I'm learning to let go of that hope. My feelings for you have been diminishing more and more. I know that you still have feelings for me no matter what you say or do. Hopefully they will perish soon. And why you may ask? Because this is the end of our chapter and there will never be another one. And I know that because I know deep down that you will never change yours ways. I know I will eventually find someone else that will appreciate my worth. It may take years but that's okay because I know it won't be you. 

Thank you for helping get personal growth and character development.",0

I #know God heard each one and HIS answer came in what was meant to completely break me.... but HE used it to push me through..

94,Hello. I recently left my ex about a month ago. I have been trying to get a restraining order against him and found out yesterday that it got denied due to lack of proof and details.

96,"So this comes with a little bit of a story.

I'm currently 22M, and my girlfriend is 24 and pregnant.

When I was 20, I was dating an extremely toxic girl whom I met when she was 5 months pregnant. I instantly had a crush on her and we started talking instantly. It was mostly over FB Messenger and snapchat. I was thrown off by the fact that some days she was super sweet to my, and literally over night she would ignore me, act like she hated me, and say she had a boyfriend now. It went back and forth switching every few days. 

When we became officially, she moved in rather quickly because her child had been born and she still lived with her parents. It's worth noting at this point that I lost my virginity to her so I became attached.

I worked graveyard at the time, and I still do. Come to find out that she cheated on me while I was at work almost every night with her Baby Daddy. I found out because he sent me screenshots mostly to taunt me. Like an idiot I let her stay and admitted it was my fault. We made up and it seemed fine until only a couple weeks after that when she started texting him using FB Messenger's secret mode(right next to me BTW) and snapchat. She did all of this blatantly and out in the open. She would claim it was just to maintain a healthy relationship with the guy for their daughter's sake. 

I started living in anxiety, stress, and just general unhappiness. I learned to look into every little thing to uncover the truth about it. Even something placed where it shouldn't be was a clue she had been cheating on me. Her not answering texts quickly enough was proof she was on the phone with him. It all added up and I was right. After a lot more of this life, I finally broke it off with her for good and started to heal. 

Right at the end of my healing process I met my current girlfriend of 1½ years. She's never been with anyone else and her family; childhood friends have told me the same. I'm her first for literally everything. I love her a lot and she loves me back. But lately I've been suspicious she's cheating on me mostly because I'm experiencing the same minute signs. She's not answering texts instantly, I'm not with her at night because I still work graveyard, and she's pregnant, about 14 weeks if it matters. She's assured me multiple times and I believe her in my heart and my gut. But the toxic relationship I endured still seems to be taking its toll on my ability to trust anyone.

How can I help get over this? How can I learn to trust my S/O more so it doesn't become a burden on her??

TL;DR: I was in a toxic relationship and got chested on with the girl her took my virginity and now I think my current girlfriend is cheating on me even though I KNOW she's not",0

So my boyfriend and I have been dating for almost a year now, and he is truly a gem. He has been sincere, is very honest, and always been there for me since the death of my father a year ago. I never have to worry about my boyfriend, i can trust him with my eyes closed. 

Anyway, he has an older brother who also has a girlfriend of many years. My boyfriend was sick one day and told him to get tested for covid, i messaged his brother that. He got really rude and i was like what personal problem do you have with me? Long story short, he said:

'My brother's only goal in life is to please you and do things to make you happy. He does not do anything else in life. he wakes up late etc. Leave him. Either he can be with you or be successful in life' 

Anyway i got really hurt and i told my boyfriend to act as if we've broken up and told his brother that too. Thats what he did, and then his brother messaged me:

' Thankyou for listening to me and leaving him. Please remove all of his friends too. You were not his first love, neither his last'

So, I am feeling overwhelmed the past days. I feel like my life is falling apart - work, finance, and family-wise.

I became unemployed 3 months ago. I was supposed to transition to another job, but for some reason, it did not happen. So I ended up being unemployed. I job searched for the past months but until now, to no avail. I sent lots of applications but only few responded - either I am not fit for the job or I am overqualified.

Problem is, my bills are piling. Loan collectors are calling me now, and even private loans from family and friends, they are asking me to pay (I loaned some because I became sick last March and needed money). I have a part time job but it is only enough for my daily needs. 

I am becoming overwhelmed and anxious. What made it worse was that my dad and I fought over this morning because he said I am 'useless'. They do not know that I am unemployed and I don't want to tell them because I would hear lot of painful words again.

I really do not know what to do. I wanted to run away. Today, I received many messages asking me to pay up and it increased my anxiety level. I really want to run away.

The problem is I love my girlfriend but I know I still have really deep feelings for someone else I have known since 2013. The girls I’ve known since 2013 (will refer to her as girl b to make it simple) was honestly the first girl I fell in love with  but as much I tried I was to nervous to tell her how I felt even though it was very obvious. We went to different high school and I decided to unfollow her on social media to try to get her off my mind but she never went away as I think of her everyday. As high school progressed opportunities came with different girls to have fun and even though I was interested I never wanted to use a girl it just felt wrong. So I decided a girl friend is what I need. In doing so I decided to start talking to a girl I knew had a crush on me and although I didn’t think she was perfect I decided that maybe if I took a chance in her I’d forget about girl B. But I knew in the back of my head when we started dating that I didn’t like her like I liked girl B but I thought with time I would start to have deeper feelings for her and in a way I was right but I also decided to break up with her. A couple days into the break up we got back together because I knew she genuinely loved me and I needed someone because I always felt alone. In the span of 3 years we grew so much together as I helped her embrace her voice and get out of her bubble and she did the same for me. Meanwhile girl b was always in my head, I could not go a day without thinking of her. Girl b and I were best friends but it always seemed like there was but more going some days and some day there was less. After got promoted to high school we didn’t really talk much and maybe that’s why I thought I could get her out of my head by unfollowing her but I guess I really hurt her although  she was the One that stopped texting as much; as we used to text almost every minute. I get that hurt her I just didn’t realize it at the time and I thought she didn’t care about me that much. She kinda grew to hate me but she also recently reached out to me after seeing me at a football game last year my heart dropped as girl b sat 3 row behind my girlfriend and I as my friend texted me saying that girl b wanted to talk but I had left to eat in n out with a friend because I knew she wanted to talk about the past. It even went so far that my friend took girl b to my house and demanded that I come out but I was eating at in n out they called my phone relentlessly as it made me lose my appetite due to how nervous I was towards confronting girl b. I decided to text girl b the next day and we both apologized and she said she just wants it all behind us now but I didn’t say everything I wanted to say. I’m now stuck with the decision of what to do. Do I tell my girlfriend everything and risk someone I have learned to love and lose the 4 years we’ve spent together?

I’m so excited to drop any connection to his narcissistic ass, tell HIM what’s going to happen for a change and make him pay to help support his children without him forcing me to return every dollar! 
I’m so much stronger than I thought I would be before I left. 
I went from not knowing if I’d live through the night to being in my own house, I have a man next to me who would do anything to take care of and protect me, we have a baby on the way now and we are looking for a property to put a house on! 
I’m proof that there IS life and happiness beyond the misery, you just have to get out, and stay out. 
I will spend my life helping other women do exactly that and teach them how to help others.
In the meantime, I’ll be planning my divorce party!!! ",0

143,"He drank a quarter gallon of alcohol within 24 hours. He quit nicotine a week and 2-3 days ago. He's been all over the place, not stable. Not respecting my boundaries but that's nothing new. He's blaming everything on quitting the nicotine but I know he is making the conscious choice to disrespect me (and other people), to not think about my feelings. He wanted to listen to music WITH me for hours (I do not like this) and after two hours of this (and it being 12am) I tried to let him know I was ready for bed. He said to me ""I feel like I should punch you in the face."" Because he could tell I did not want to listen to music anymore. That made me feel sick to my stomach and obviously scared. He pushed it for another 2 hours, making me do things I did not want to do. From 10pm to 3am he berated me, a lot of it being drunken stupidness and calling me names, but none the less making me feel terrible and not allowing me to have a choice wether or not I wanted to be around him. I hate feeling powerless like this. No one stands up to him, he won't accept it if someone actually does stand up to him. it's always everyone else's issue or fault. I'm so tired of this and want to move on from this relationship as I know he won't ever change and I've already wasted 5 years of my life being with him and trying to work with him on his issues. I'm tired of my life being consumed by him and his issues.",1

145,"Is it considered rape/abuse if you don't want to have sex but he keeps forcing you to and gets mad if you don't and starts arguments accusing you of sleeping with someone elsebecause you don't want to be pleasurable to him? We've been together ten years, he's 48 and I'm 30, and he's made me have sex with him even when I didn't want to. We've even physically fought sometimes because I didn't want to have sex with him or he would accuse me of sleeping with somebody else and fight me if he felt like it wasn't wet enough or tight enough for his liking. But when you're forcing someone to want to have sex it's not going to be the same as if she willingly wanted to do it. I'm so tired of feeling sick to my stomach everytime I lay down in my own bed. I literally feel like I want to throw up right at this very moment. I want out of this relationship so bad I can taste it on my tongue.

I’m here because two days ago I was hit in the face  by my boyfriend in front of my kids while I was driving. Luckily I was able to stop the car and after struggling with him because he took my phone to stop me from calling the cops was able to get out of the car and stop other cars to get help. He ran after more people pulled over to see what happened.
Yesterday he was caught and was arrested and was found with heroin and drug paraphernalia on him. I’m so torn and my emotions are all over the place. I will be seeking out a therapist for me and my 5 year old daughter who was very close to my boyfriend. My eye is black and blue with a gash right below my eyebrow and a gash on my nose. My physical pain will heal but it will take some time for my emotional and mental pain to heal. It’s going to be a long process and hopefully I can get through this.
Thanks for listening.",1

154,"The thing about Real love? Is that it can never hurt. Only our bad experiences…our worst trials. Make love sometimes appear the worst. Love was never meant to be a game. Never supposed to make us cry. But when one abuses our love and betrays us? Our hearts want to give up the fight. When love is abused…and trust is broken like a seal. It is the pain that blinds us. And make us wonder if true love is even real. When our love for the one in the past was only left to wither….it is the rejection we feel that makes us cold and bitter. But the one that chooses to look past the heart in the very face of pain? Is indeed the one who knows love is true. And this truth is how we begin again. Don’t ever think that love is the reason for your pain. Love will never hurt us. It was never meant to be a game. 



As a female…I know sometimes it feels that every man will hurt you. And no man will treasure your heart. But I believe that not all men are the same . Men have been hurt by women too. Not all women will break your heart. A soul that will cherish your heart no matter what. This is the love I wish for. And you wish for it too",0

we went out drinking, got into an argument over me saying his friend is immature because he punched a random guy in the face for no reason.

we got back home and he was pretty much black out drunk and freaked out on me, said his best friend comes first blah blah blah. i got mad and wanted to leave his house so i tried to get an uber. he grabbed my face and squeezed my face and said i’m not leaving. i kept trying to walk out of his bedroom and he was blocking the door. he then grabbed me by the throat and threw me on the bed. pinned me down with my face smushed down on the mattress and he laid on top of me and told me i’m not leaving. i started crying because he held me down by the throat for at least 2 minutes. when he got off me he was blocking the door and wouldn’t let me out. we went to sleep. the next morning i brought it up and he said “you have a good boyfriend and you need to realize that. you deserved it. i’d never hit you but i felt threatened because you wanted to leave and i didn’t want you to. plus you probably liked it anyways”",1

Instead of letting my abusive partner tear me apart and destroy me, I made different life choices that led me to seek out how I could help others like me. So I went back to school and now I’m a Board certified Life & success coach, clinical hypnotherapist, EFT, NLP & T.I.M.E techniques practitioner

160,"Am I an ass if I don’t want my girlfriend to be in contact with her ex?

For some context before her relationship with him ( which lasted about 2 years on and off) they were childhood friends. They basically have known each other for 10 or more years. They grew up right around the block from each other and basically hung out all of their childhood. I believe he was also her first relationship. Fast forward to last week was her birthday which I expected him to message her about and then ask for updates on her. That day we drove about two hours to go visit her mother. She seemed like her regular self nothing out of the ordinary. I ended up falling asleep early after dinner while she was still awake. Fast forward to today I noticed she has seemed a little off lately and more reserved. Something just seemed off about her. 
I decided to check her conversation between her and him (both of us have given each other permission to go through another’s phone, we both know each others passwords). When I quick glanced through the conversation I noticed that they basically talked the whole day together on her birthday while I was with her over her mothers house. I also noticed that she was replying and texting him almost instantly. This is something that she never does especially whenever I text her and I know she’s on her phone. The conversation was pretty lengthy that first started with updates and then progressed into him stating they should meet up again at home (2hrs away). Which she agreed. Throughout the conversation there was no mention of me. No update on how her relationship in a new state was going. Just about her and how the dog we got together was doing. 
Fast forward to yesterday she was texting him about a vacation they had together in Dominican Republic and how much fun it was and how they should have just bought property there. Then they were going back and forth just remembering their vacation together. This is going on while she’s hanging out with me at home while we are both off from work. 
Basically throughout the relationship I have had to hear about this guy in some way almost everyday. Whether this would be about previous vacations they had, his family, or even his pets. Basically almost everything relates back to him with some variation of when Sebastian and I did…. 
She has had a few other relationships after that one and before us. I know that while she was on and off in a previous relationship before me, they started seeing each other again. Last time they were together which was about two years ago they were friends with benefits. 
Im just not sure if I’m over thinking all of this but I plan on talking to her about it. I understand that she has known him and had a relationship of some sort with him all of her life practically. I just don’t know what to think about all of this. I just wanted to get some neutral unbiased opinions on this from you guys. Take into account that my bias is definitely showing here and it just seems sketchy to me the whole situation. What is your advice and opinions?",0

164,After dealing with his mess for over 2 years today was a wake up call for me. He got overly drunk got mad at everything I did or said punched the wall and then started to punch me in my head my face my stomach. If that wasn't good enough he grabbed a gun we had locked up and pulled it on me and said I better start listening to him or walk out of his house.

169,"The hardest part of healing has been learning to forgive myself for allowing the abuse to continue for so long. I knew it was wrong but I still allowed it. I hoped he would change knowing deep down he wouldn’t. I felt like a complete and utter idiot for believing him. So recently (two weeks ago) it hit me that I’m being to hard on myself. If he managed to fool his lawyer (who believes everything she is told), police and even the crown. It can’t be me that’s the fool, he is just that good at presenting himself in a certain light. Point is, for those who are struggling to forgive yourselves, know that it wasn’t you, they just are Oscar winners and could fool anyone. It was a great epiphany!",0

He’s hit 8 times and spit on 5. He verbally & emotionally abuses me but he says I do all that to him & he’s just responding to what I say. 
He’s been pushing me away. My friends are over an hour to see. His friends are 10 min away and he tells me to get a life. He wants more time with friends and he says I’m up his ass all the time. I don’t make friends easily and tend to be alone with my major depressive disorder. That makes it worse. He wants to hang out with his mom & best friend. Really?! 
My heart is in so much pain I cry all the time or become livid. If I kept my mouth shut this wouldn’t happen. 
Oddly enough I love him. I’ve NEVER dealt with anyones shit in a relationship. Why now Is beyond me. Plus when we fight he won’t have sex with me. We rarely do and it’s almost 2 years together. 
This makes me feel so ugly, fat, worthless, alone, livid, unloved and feel that people really don’t care.

I've always wanted a sword and when my grandparents gave one to my brother, I was salty, but now I'm going to have a whole ass lightsaber!

Even though I know I should be grateful for any amount of time considering how many people don't get any justice at all. My plan was to go to see him being sentenced so I could say what I needed to say, hear him admit guilt and feel some sort of closure. I couldn't even face him because I feel jipped. Like he won again. We listened to it livestream and my mom cried, my sister cried and I just felt blah. Like with all the time taken off with good behavior he will be out in a few years and he'll just come after us again. How do I stop feeling so negative towards this?

176,"I feel really low lately. I'm 26 yo female, and I just feel like I'm just here on this earth without having asked to exist. Not wanting to.  
I hate myself for having certain people in my life, keeping certain people in my life, ever having some people in my life, the way I am at work, the way I am at home, my inability to guide myself through life, my hostile attitude and anger management but also my quiet anger in public. I feel like people walk all over me. I have much to be grateful for like parents who support me, dogs, nice housing because I live with my parents...which makes me hate myself that I feel so sad and empty all the time despite having all those mentioned to be grateful for. 
I can't settle on a career, I've been in school nonstop since kindergarten, and ive changed from veterinarian to PA to RN to now just wanting to quit everything. Now I have a biology degree and work in a lab while in nursing school but I'm not happy. I wouldn't say I'm doing particularly well in nursing school either nor am I enjoying the idea of being a nurse. I want to live out my life with little consequence. Give dogs a home and take care of my parents until my time comes. I'm essentially doing what I'm doing for monetary stability in order to do the above. But I lack friends, direction, and passion in my life. I guess as opposed to the average late 20s post grad. I also have this debilitating inability to let things go... past trauma, anger, sadness, bad people in my life 

TLDR; I'm lonely and lack direction in my life. I am unhappy going to school for nursing but scared to leave as I have no other goals. I'm working in a job using my first bachelors degree that I am unhappy in. I feel isolated and without friends and strongly incapable to connect with people at work or school. My parents are retiring and I want to get my shit together before they need me to support them in their old age.

His stuff is still at my apartment which I am more than willing to give but only if an officer is with us watching. 

He has literally laid outside the front door of my apartment for hours without leaving when his name isn’t on the lease and he technically isn’t even allowed on property (said directly from my apartments manager)

180,"Need some advice. Me and this girl hit it off really good, we matched on bumble and began talking right away. She wasn’t comfortable meeting up at first but after a few weeks of texting we went out for breakfast back in April. After that she said she wanted to see me again so we kept dating. In early June she asked me if I wanted a relationship and she confessed she really likes me and really wants a relationship with me. I said yes that’s what I want and I thought everything is good. Lockdown hit Sydney and we kept seeing each other until early July, and she’s started going a little distant and I asked her if everything was ok. She said she’s second guessing whether she wants a relationship, she’s not sure if it’s her anxiety due to Covid (she’s got some prexisting conditions so I can see her worry) or if she actually likes being with someone. She said she has strong feelings for me, loves doing stuff with me and spending time together but isn’t sure. I said I’m not sure what to say but instead of ending things if you have feelings for me we should at least try? She expressed she wanted to try than just give up but she’s still a bit distant. We haven’t seen each other due to the lockdowns and her anxiety about Covid so I respect that. But I’m not sure what to do about her second guessing. I’ve noticed when I message her she takes a lot longer to get back to me than she used to, to the point of I respond to a message she’ll come online and then go offline, if I double message she responds straight after the second message. If I leave her on read cause her message is like the end of a conversation she’ll contact me later on. I don’t know if I’m overthinking all this cause of the lockdowns or she’s shifted her interest. But if she’s not interested she wouldn’t engage in conversation about her daily life? Not sure what to do.

186,"At the end of last year I randomly sent a drunk, coked up text to my old boss. It wasn’t suggestive in the slightest. Just plain weird. My girlfriend then discovered those texts and was like: ‘WTF is this?’
It caused a massive rift in our relationship and has led her to be suspicious of other females, who aren’t family, in my life. I had never had any relationship with my old boss other than a professional one. Out of the blue and having not texted the old boss since that drunken night (close to 9 months ago), she messaged me saying she might have a job for me. I hate my current job and she knows that. My girlfriend knows that too and we have been discussing potential career changes. This job would be in the same industry. How do I broach this subject with my GF without her flipping it?",0

195,"Is there anyone out there? I’m tired of waking up everyday to nothing. I’m tired being ignored and feeling like I don’t matter. For fucks sake, is it too much to ask for just to feel like I matter sometimes? It doesn’t even have to be all the time, just like once a month or something. 
I don’t know, I try to not let it get to me, and I do a great job at hiding all of my feelings and keeping this act up that everything is fine and I’m perfectly ok with the fact that I don’t matter, but sometimes it gets to me. I guess that’s what’s happening right now, it’s just getting to me is all. 
I know they say love yourself and all of that bullshit, but god damn. When no one cares, it’s hard to do that. Even the people that are supposed to care no matter what, unconditionally or whatever, your family, your parents. When they don’t even care, how the fuck am I supposed to care? I’m just a product of their stupid actions, an accident. Shit they remind me all the time anyways. 
They set me up for failure, then they blame me for being a failure. I mean it is my fault im a failure, don’t get me wrong, I could just keep pretending like nothing bothers me and I have no needs or wants or anything, and just keep going, or I could just give in and stop hurting every day.

Also, how do you cope with this . i’m a mess, i’m sorry",0
199,I ask myself why I tolerate the way he treats/treated me... Bc I would NEVER condone my sister or daughter allowing a man they date to treat them as such. He isnt sorry... he shows no emotion other than anger and self pity for himself. Making himself the victim. I think the majority of us are with men who genuinely have anger issues or hate themselves and we are the closest they have to an outlet so we get their frustrations and anger full force. Are they all monsters? Maybe not. But it isnt just monsters that hurt or even kill... People loose their temper and in a momentary lack of control snap. Last weekend my fiancee slammed on breaks going over 70mph and threw me forward and causing my seatbelt to cut into my chest and snap my head twice-- also almost rolling our car in a ditch. I dont think hes all bad.. but it doesnt matter. He doesnt have to be all bad to hurt me once and end my life. Just my little epiphany today.,1
200,"I LADIES,
In addition to growing up in a domestic violence home I have always wondered what can we have people from around the world do to break the cycle?  It’s very disappointing that the fingers are always pointed at the victims lacking the attention on the perpetrators and the surroundings including our history and even religion in some instances that have supported this kind of behavior since the beginning of times. So my question is, what can we do more to protect ourselves and demand better initiatives for victims. Do we need mandatory education for children on how to treat women? fight for policy changes and greater sentences for perpetrators, ??????? What would be a solution other than disappearing all perpetrators",0

I know money isn't everything but we all need it to have a better life and improve ourselves.

It’s not that I have anything against her but we don’t click and I’m fine with that but I can see why my brother pushes me. They’ll probably be together for a long time and have kids.

She has always been emotionally unavailable due to her rough upbringing. She does open up to me about how she feels about things and she says you’re the person with whom I have shared most of the things. 

But she never tells me if I say something wrong and will keep that thing in her mind. As an anxiously attached individual, I have a lot of trouble dealing with this. Moreover, I am very upfront and blunt about everything and tell her whenever I find something wrong.

She says she’s trying her best but she “wouldn’t promise”. I am always scared of this. I always think what if I say something wrong and I never get to know about that and she keeps that thing in her heart always and it keeps getting bitter and bitter.

At night, when I was all tucked into bed and ready to sleep, he was next to me. I was feeling so bad after having a bad day that I broke down just as we were about to fall asleep. He sat upright and I thought he was annoyed with me, that made me cry a bit more. He sat cross-legged, took me by my arm (I was facing away from him) and just said ""come here"" in a soft whisper.

I sat on his lap, wrapped my arms and legs around him and cried. It was a chilly night so he wrapped the blanket around the both of us and slowly rocked back and forth while rubbing my back slowly and giving me light/soft kisses here and there. At one point he whispered ""cry your heart out if you want to dear, ive got you"". And I did, I cried quite a bit but it was okay, he was there, rocking me back and forth gently in his embrace, reassuring me and giving me soft kisses throughout.

After I was done, I felt so much better. I was smiling and giggling a bit too. He gave me more kisses, quickly ran his fingers through my hair, smiled and tickled me too. It was such a nice feeling after crying so much that my eyes felt sore. He cuddled with me to sleep, making sure I was okay. 

I'm so grateful.",0

I asked him to go to the supermarket I used to work at to return my uniform, etc. He's got absolutely nothing to do. And he almost refused and said maybe. While I have always done the tiniest thing he asked for no matter how Inconvenient it was. He was also a bit bitter. And I feel should be used to that. After we hang up, I felt really bad, like I really don't want to go back to our life. And then I started texting him and asking him if our life is getting any better.

I keep putting everything I’ve learnt into practice. It makes me feel a bit better for a short time and then I find myself in this thought that it’s all fake. I’m not really happy if everyday I have to convince myself of it. I’m just fake smiling, pretending everything is okay because from the outside my life does look pretty good. So why don’t I feel that? Is that how the next 30 years of my life will be? Saying to myself every morning, “smile, life is good”. When do I start believing myself? I tried throwing myself into old hobbies, seeing friends, mindfulness etc. Yet the joy is only temporary. I understand we have to have bad days to appreciate the good but the balance is far off. 
I cannot work out what truly makes me happy. How do I want to spend the rest of my life? I feel like I’m trekking through thick mud with a smile on my face hoping there’s a meadow on the other side, but the horizon gets further away with each step.
I’m just struggling to see the point in it all. I’m not happy and I have no idea why or how to change that. I’m sick of faking my happiness.

It took a while just for them to respond when I wanted to bounce back as friends.  They admitted they’re not mad, but said they’ve been dealing with a lot of personal things and also don’t want to lead me on.  I reassured them that wouldn’t be the case, that I valued the friendship, and that I promised not to read into things when we talk. I got no reply and it’s been a couple of weeks.  

Few things to be clear- I didn’t enter this friendship out of hopes of doing something more, the feelings just gradually happened.  Also, it was a casual “confession” where I said I’m interested in potentially something more but would be okay if it wasn’t mutual, it wasn’t like a big “I love you” blow out.  They said things wouldn’t change, but clearly they did and I feel I can only blame myself for taking that risk.",0

I don't do relationships not even sleeping around because it's just not me and I'm okay with that you know. I just can't seem to open up to a guy in a way that would class as more than friends. I'm quite open but if I feel like they want more than being friends, then I shut off a lil.

I don't know how to feel about this guy because he flirts around a lot and it comes off as a joke and I rebuff it. I never flirt back with anyone and just joke back. I like the guy as a friend and he said the same too but sometimes I feel like he's really trying to get me to open up more and he'll bring up the possibilities of me being in a relationship quite often.

To be honest I thought he was either a 'nice guy' or an fboy from the first couple of times I met him because of the things he said but after getting to know him, it doesn't seem to be the case. I've watched movies with the guy online cause he suggested it and I didn't mind cause I didn't think much of it but in hindsight, was it something that could make him think that I'm interested in him? I mean he knows that I don't like men (not a man hater just had really bad experiences with men since a child till now and its put me off from wanting to date) and he's brought it up, so he's aware but am I stringing him along by wanting to game or watch movies with him? I genuinely don't think much of it and I made it all clear to him but I don't know what to do when someone wants me to open up to them in a completely different way.

If I say I don’t want kids they say “it’s not your choice, you have to have children” they put me up to such high standards. I still have to ask them if I can go out with my friends even if I turn 30",0
228,I’m 19 and so is he as well I have gone through physical abuse while pregnant and mental abuse for 3 years now I have two children with him who both my mom and I are basically raising but I just wnated to ask did anyone else every wish that their abuser was dead I know it’s harsh and I might get terrible comments but I don’t know why I cnat leave and I feel like I’m never gonna be able too so that’s why I always wish that but I was just wondering if anyone else did or if I’m just insane,1
229,"Hi. I am really struggling. First time I’ve posted in this group but looking for support. Just about two weeks ago I pressed charges against my husband for sexual assault. There’s a no contact order in place. And all our mutual friends have shut me out.I am having a really hard time with dealing. I love the guy. Yes, he hurt me. Yes, he’s abusive. Yes, I’m safe now. And I understand that. But I love him deeply. We have a son together. We built a family. And now to not be able to see him, talk to him, explain anything. It’s breaking me in half. The physical pain and agony I am in overwhelms any of the thoughts I have or could have. I am unable to eat. Unable to sleep. Struggling to take care of my son on my own. As well as our dog. I hate this. Everybody says that it will be hard. But everything seems impossible! Nobody said anything about the physical agony of all of this. How everybody would leave or just not talk to you because there is the law involved now.",1

231,"My physical pain is healing but I know I still have a long way to go emotionally and mentally. Every woman always thinks when they watch movies, tv shows, hear about other women being abused that “that will never be me.” I was with my boyfriend for less than a year but didn’t realize all the emotional and mental abuse he was doing until he got physical with me 3 days ago. He would always say the right things, act the right way and pull me back in. Not this time though. While he sits in jail I am here trying to heal the pain he caused me and my kids. Trying to get past all this pain while my heart is breaking because I did love him and I did want us to work out and him be a father to my kids. That all changed when he put his hands on me and sent me to the hospital. I go back to work tomorrow still with a black and blue eye and with healing scars. Trying to get my life back the way it was before him. I know it’ll get better but I wish I never had to experience this kind of pain",1
232,"So, I am the youngest in my immediate family. The oldest is my cousin who recently got married through a matrimonial site. But the thing is, while my uncle was making that site she was probably aware of it. 
My father today asked me to make one, as the second oldest sibling, who is my sister, just turned 27. I live in a traditional Indian family, so 25 above is the age where women are pressured about marriage. 
Last year my sister had a meltdown over the marriage conversation and so my father understood, or pretended to, and had stalled everything since then, but today he comes over to me, asks me to keep everything confidential and make her profile. It took my uncle 3 years to find my brother in law, so I understand that my sister was being a bit irrational before since it is going to take a lot of time to find anybody, but I firmly believe she should know about this. I tried to explain my parents the whole thing, that she should know what is going in HER PROFILE atleast, but they didn't want to listen and they started being melodramatic. Sort of the typical Indian parent thing if you ask me. They said they would let her know when they start finding suitable matches. (She will not be wedded without her and us knowing the guy, I assure you. She can very well reject if she doesn't like him, its just the profile thing) What do I do? Should I make the profile? I am a good secret keeper but a terrible liar. This feels like lying. 
About my sister's relationship status, in the beginning she seemed committed to this guy, but he was definitely not serious about her. I have talked to him casually on my sister's request (she is the type of person who sort of remains stuck on this one guy and tries to get him friendly with me.) and I didn't really like him? Throughout the last year, even though I didn't want to intrude, I couldn't help but see how she would cry every few months. It is/was (I don't know) a VERY on and off relationship. I don't even think she knows where this is going. Last year she told him that our parents and uncle are serious about the marriage thing but even then nothing happened. So I truly think she should move on from this guy. She gets really stuck in relationships no matter how undeserving the other person is. 
I could give her a warning, she would pretend she doesn't know about the profile, but if a fight occurs this might probably will get mentioned and then my parents will be very disappointed with me. 
Don't know what to do. Please help.",0
233,I cant bring myself to care. My familiar comfort zone feels less scary than going out into the world to a shelter.

She assured me she had nothing to hide and that I could go through her phone anytime. I did the same to her yesterday I found pictures and videos that she sent to her ex’s. She kept all of the chats with them. One video I saw was her getting fucked by another guy. I know she loves me so much and I love her so much as well.

He tried another tactic and I did not react. We have spoke a few times in these 2 weeks very briefly about our daughter. The tactic he is trying now is deciding he does not want to go to church on Sundays. The past two sundays 😂 as the whole household is getting dressed up and ready to go he’s pouting and staying behind 😂 still I’m not reacting and only being calm. In 4 1/2 years I have always reacted but this is the longest I have not. He is losing his power slowly.

249,"The amount of pain is unbearable. The breakup happened because he didn't want to hold me back, he didn't want to influence my life decisions or be a bad influence on me. On top of that he has a lot of shit going on with his toxic family and can only just cope with his own mental health through unhealthy coping mechanisms (drink, drugs).

He said that I'm one of the only things that made him happy, that I deserve the world and so much better than him, but I was so happy with how thing were going before I was blindsided. I was finally working in my mental health issues in a way that worked, spending more time to myself and setting myself boundaries. Then this happened and as a result I had to transfer jobs to avoid seeing him all the time, losing the community I'd built there over the past 2 years.

We've hooked up and spoken in the month following it which delayed the healing for sure, so we chatted the other night via video call, confirming that we need to go no contact, despite how much we still care for each other. The pain is too much. I still struggle to understand why this has happened if I made him happy, if I gave him purpose. I can't cope.",0

257,"I used to see my father as my hero, just like any other kid. As I grew up, I found out my mom divorced him because he cheated on her with several other women during their engagement, did drugs (sometimes leaving them out wherever in the house, putting me at risk for accidentally eating one), constantly went to casinos, went to jail thrice, and was overall an ass. 

I realized how he would always put his own child second to his own needs and egoistical self. He was a borderline uninvolved parent and put all the work on my mom for raising me. I cut him off because I knew it was for the best (especially after he made me pee in a bottle to hide the fact that he was still doing drugs [I was ten when this happened so I had no idea just how bad that was]) . Besides, I found out he never wanted to have a child to begin with. Nonetheless, the memories I thought were good ones with him stuck with me, like how he would call me his little monkey, buy me ice cream occasionally, take me to the movies, etc.

I remember when my mom was in the process of divorcing him, he would stalk her because he was obsessed with her, would use me as a way to get closer to her, and one time made a hole in the wall out of anger after she refused to call off the divorce. Yes, he was a bad person. 

Either way, I can't help but remember the ""hero"" I used to have. I feel so disappointed knowing that the moments I cherished with him probably meant nothing to him. I have a step-dad who treats me a lot better than my father ever did, so it's not like I'm lacking a fatherly figure. My mom is hardworking, stays healthy, and teaches me the right things, so why do I still feel this way? I had amazing grades in school, my group of friends, and led what many would consider a fortunate and happy life. I know my worth and know that it's best to cut him off and not contact him.

Every chance I got, I partied and he went fishing or camping.  I suggested a break, just to give us space away from eachother,  we were young when we met (me 19 and him 22) and we had spent 6 long years together. 

But it seems he prefers his peace away from me and has decided to lock me off and be very cruel with me. He wants no contact and from what I've heard from him he has nothing bit hatred towards me.

But its like he's ignoring all the good times, we travelled the world together and I don't see how he can just let that go.

Since the breakup I've done everything to numb the pain. Drink, drugs, sex with other men. Obviously not working

I'm still a single mom of two. I still struggle to work full time and be  mom and dad. I still feel like I'll never love or trust again. I still see dating as impossible.

274,"Since my childhood, i have seen the world through the eyes of money. As soon as i see something, i try to valuate things. Money has been a strong driving force in my life. No matter how much i chase money, it just slips away and leaves me in a depressed state of mind and a feeling of worthlessness. Any advice on how to cope with this kind of mental state would be really helpful. Thank you.",0
275,"I just want to say that once you leave, it really does get better over time. After spending almost every waking moment with my abuser for 3 years, I am re learning how to do the most basic tasks by myself. I've gone to the mechanic alone, carried heavy groceries upstairs alone, made whatever I want to for dinner and watch whatever I want to on TV. I also get to go the gym more often now because I dont have to ""babysit"" him anymore. I'm never in a hurry anymore or wondering when the next moments of abuse will come. 

It gets better. Dont get me wrong, there are good and bad days. But getting to know myself again is becoming less of a scary process and more of a beautiful one. Just thought I would share some encouragement .",0
276,I’m meeting with an attorney tomorrow to start the divorce process. He knows where I’m at (staying with friends in another state) and I’m afraid he’ll come after me. My fiends are moving at the end of the month so I was thinking of waiting until then. The only problem with that is I think he’s beginning to suspect I’m not coming back and might take action (either legal or destroying things)…he’s very calculating and so is his entire family so I could see them making moves quickly. Any advice on what the right path forward is?,1

He’s just a passing thought that comes up a bit too much. I know how to deal with those better though since I have intrusive thoughts all the time.

My only fear is that once the restraining order is up he’ll try to contact me and knock down all my hard work. I can’t be put into that mental place again...I don’t think I’d survive it.

I know I’m not 100% but the fact that I feel even slightly happy is huge for me. I know there is a lot more to go through and it’s still an uphill battle but I’m here! I’m fucking feeling something other than sadness and numbness. I’m so excited!

A few months ago he went to jail and against my better judgement I decided to forgive him and still be there for him hoping he would change. He did change a little bit. He hasn't hit me since he has been home, but his mouth has stayed the same. I swear his words hurt way more than his hands ever have. I use to cut myself because made me feel relief and satisfaction. Just recently I started cutting again just to feel better. I know that sounds crazy but I can't explain it. It went from cutting my arms to cutting my face. I dont feel like myself. Ive never experienced this before and I feel like I am losing the battle. I have no one to talk to because I dont want anyone to know I go through this.

291,"[TL;DR] I don’t know what I am doing with my life and if things are going to get better in future .

So I am a twenty year old final year medical student, and I am going to be 21 years old in two days (it’s 19th august at the time of writing this post, my birthday is on 21st).
My problem is not very specific, so I’d appreciate any kind of help or advice.

Firstly I don’t think I am very passionate about medicine, I am fascinated by it but I think that if I become a doctor, I won’t be a very good one, because my score were pretty average throughout my MBBS and as a child I never thought I’d be a doctor, I always had something else in mind.
So that kind of makes me think what I am doing with my life, why am I studying something I am not really passionate about, was getting into medicine a good idea.
I do get motivated when I see a doctor treating patients but I guess that’s just me getting fascinated by this profession.

Secondly I am almost 21 and I’ve never been in a relationship, and up until last year I never actually even talked to a girl (because I think I am very introverted around strangers)

Last year in January a girl started talking to me, and I got comfortable with her pretty soon, and as you might have guessed I started liking her after about 4-5 months of talking, and at that time I didn’t say anything to her because I could tell she wasn’t interested in me but after an year of being friends with her I confessed because I could not keep it a secret anymore and she obviously rejected me. That broke me and I have three friends but because of this pandemic everyone is at their home and we are not talking to each other a lot, so I am feeling very lonely since then, I used to feel lonely even when she was around but in my mind I used to think that at least “she is around”, but now that she is gone, I pretty much have no one to who I can talk to.

So keep thinking if I’ll ever find someone for myself, because I need a lot of time to get comfortable with a person and get to know that person before I can start to have feelings and I guess that will be problem in future.",0

He’s literally said to me “sometimes when I look at you I just hate you so much I can’t stand it” but I STILL FEEL BAD. WHYYYYYYYY

So I'm on my way he asks if he can stay the night with the kids( I have them fill time , he's trying to move back down from 4 hours away) I said no I don't feel comfortable with you staying. With him being the crazy narcissist he is trying to tell me it will be fine I'll leave tomorrow...well his story kept changing didn't know where he was going the next day or what not I didn't feel comfortable telling him yes he kept going which made it to where we were now fighting and all of this is not ok around kids. Finally I had enough said ok put her in the truck your not going buckled in my kids and I left even though he was mad and before that crying and making my daughter through a fit..I still said no! Girls don't ever give in anymore if you don't want to stick with your guns . No means no and stick to it . They will be mad but they will get over.

301,y first boyfriend alienated me from my friends and family. He got me addicted to Heroin and he and his mother tried to turn me out . They forced me to work in a massage parlor untill I was violently raped. My ex was verbally and emotionally abusive. He almost strangled me to death when I finally stood up for myself. I left after that got sober and went back to my family. I have attracted many men since that I found later were also very violent thank god they did not hurt me. I am currently in a long term relationship with a good man that I thought I loved. He was a abused by an alcoholic father. He has trouble showing emotions toward me and I feel like he is just using me for sex but I stay because he would never lay hands on me.

Then tells you if you at least respected her you would break up with her rather than drag this out.

I’ve been talking with my therapist and she thinks I should find away to remind myself of it, like maybe a small tattoo. But I don’t want a tattoo, so I thought I would turn my razor blade into a necklace or a bracelet. I just wanted to know, is this a bad idea? I’ve dulled the blade down so it doesn’t cut anymore, so it’s safe. I put it on a chain and I’m wearing it under my sweater just to see how it feels. I’m not wearing it to be edgy or insensitive, but I think it helps me and it seems to be having a positive effect on me.

About 2 years ago she split up with her boyfriend and attempted suicide by overdose. I believe this was a cry for help and she wanted medical professionals to see how desperate she was. They just sent her home that day. Fast forward to today, my mum has been on again off again with this ex boyfriend. He’s no good for her, he’s a coke addict, buys illegal Valium and not to mention extremely abusive (only physical once that I know of).

I’m beyond frustrated and upset at the lack of help she’s getting. Also I called the police on the ex who was in the house when I got in (smashed mirror/tv, blood all over my mums clothes and a clump of hair that had been pulled out my mums head). The police were no help either they just removed him from the premises and said to me we’ve all had a boyfriend no one else likes. I’m really struggling myself and want her to get help.

My mom stood behind and saw what happened to me, he took me to the back of the house and thrashed me on the ground, the back street.
People usually spill alot of broken glasses on the back house  to prevent theft, so they all got inserted on my back and I still have the deep scars which didn't get fill up yet.

329,"About a week ago a guy on reddit, lied about his age, told me he was 17 and got me to sext with him. I was lonely and horny so I agreed to. I even sent him a recording of me moaning while I was touching myself. I showed him my face and a few hours later when I asked him to show me his he asked me whether I would be mad if he wasn't 17. That's when he told me his actual age. He even got me and another 15 year old girl to participate in a virtual threesome on discord even when i told him i was not comfortable with it and didn't wanna do it. About 2 days of explaining and arguing,  I told him to delete my recording, and then blocked and reported his account. He told me that he was sorry, and that he would stop talking to me and the other girlS. Later, the other girl, told me that he was asking for the recording of me moaning, because previously, he had sent it to her, even though she didn't ask for it. She's a nice person. I trust her. She asked me whether she should send it to him and when I said no she said okay. 


Im just annoyed and angry due to the fact that he lied to me. He told me that he would stop talking to me and the other (probably) underage girls. But he still talks to the other girl. She just ignores him. Im pretty sure he'd still text me if hadn't blocked him. 


I want this guy in prison. What he has been doing, is doing, is not okay, and I wanna put a stop to it. Problem is, there's a time difference of 15 and a half hours so he lives literally half way across the world. Im indian, and..from the timezone..Im assuming he's American. Also, I cannot tell any of this to my parents. I cannot let them know. Under any circumstances. So I need this to be done secretly. Should I send him a friend request on discord and talk to him about it? I cant just sit here knowing that he's out there still sexting talking to underage girls on the internet. Or can someone report him to the police and put him behind bars somehow? Without me having to get involved? I have screenshots which serve as evidence of his pedophilic nature. I just need someone to do it for me without me getting involved. What can I do?",0

I was only 5 when they started dating and I didnt see the abuse until I came across the word gaslighting one day.

Hes extremely narcissist and loves to gaslight people. He always says that we are lying and only he remembers situations the right way. He has everything in his name, my moms name is on nothing.

346,"Husband (29M) and I (25F) have been together 7 years. He never ever showed signs of being abusive until this last year. About a year ago we got into a huge fight that has taken all this time to recover from, because we both did and said things we regret badly.

Lately his temper flies off the handle. It started out a few months ago when I went to bed during a fight because I didn’t want to argue. He came in the bedroom, flipped on the lights, and flipped the mattress over while I was on it and said you are going to fucking talk to me.

Now he is gotten into the habit of leaving the house whenever I try to express my feelings. He says I am a manipulative lying bitch. So I stand in front of the door because years ago that would have worked because he wouldn’t have put his hands on me. Now he says move or I’ll move you and he grabs my shoulders and throws me in the floor. He has done this several times. 

This morning we got into a fight over something he misunderstood that I said. I followed him into the kitchen because he wouldn’t quit walking away from me. He told me he was going to hurt me if I didn’t go away. I stayed because I didn’t believe him. He put his arm around my neck and said how do you like that? I hit him because I was defending myself. 

Then he told me if I ever yelled again I would be picking my teeth off the floor.

I know it sounds like the no brainer option would be to leave, but I wish I knew why he was so angry. Why he has no tolerance for me anymore. Up until last year he was my best friend and would hurt any man who he ever saw lay hands on a woman. He has become the kind of person he hates. Also, I always get reeled back in... he was just cuddling up to me last night saying you’re my favorite person ever and Im so glad you are mine. Stuff like that. Kissing all over me. He will do that for about two weeks at a time and then become a monster again. My emotions are all over the place because during those two weeks of change I always think things are going to go back to normal. Like they were before our big fight a year ago. 

I don’t know what to do. I want to make it work but his temper is out of control. I have a brand new iPhone 11 and he got mad because I was on it one time and threw it across the room and shattered it. There are several holes in our walls. I just don’t know why he’s so violent and destructive now.

Like I said I know the obvious answer is to leave, but I want to believe he is capable of being who he used to be. I want to believe we can be ok again because I do love him so much. I just don’t know what to do.",1

You told me you feel like you can't be happy or content in relationships. You told me you weren't looking into having anymore kids or getting married. One month after saying those words, you jump into a relationship with a girl that has a baby. Makes so much sense.

360,"It's going to be 3 months in 3 days that we've been broken up and no contact. Just need to get this off my chest

Everything was happy with my ex (dumper) during the 10years, even though we see each other once a week and some weeks 2x. I know it isn't much but during those years I had to look after my grandparents (dementia, one after the other), going to school, going to work etcetc, you know be an adult and earn money. 

When the pandemic hit and studying for 3 exam my mental health went down hill. The pandemic pretty much forced me to slow down in life and my mind was able to wander/think. My ex never seen me so down before (word for word), he did the minimal comfort but something in me wanted more but I didn't know what it was. Prior to the breakup he wanted to move our relationship to the next stage in life - marriage. When he mentioned it, my anxiety/panic shot up like a missle. I was scared, I couldn't entirely pinpoint why I'm scared but I think it was because of my mother (brief: mom doesn't like my ex, dated behind her back, had childhood trauma - emotional neglect, raised to be independent, can not be vulnerable to anyone, people pleaser etcetc).

Prior to the break up, I told him I was in the process of seeing a therapist to see what is wrong with my mind, why I'm scared. I do see a future with him, living in a house with white picket fence with our child running around in the backyard. To be honest, at the beginning of the relationship I never had that fear..probably I subconciously changed during those years being together. After trying my best to explain and articulate my feelings - in his head, he probably thinks I've been stringing him along all those years and treated him as a second options. Which isn't true at all, I poured my heart, soul, body in this relationship. He said because I was scared of my mom and unable to stand by his side, he will find someone new. He wanted me to say something for him to stay in the relationship, but I respect myself to not beg and give empty promises...so I let him go. A little bit after a month he found someone new and made it official in all social media platform (I have him muted). Not sure if it's a rebound because he said he didn't even think of breaking up with me a week before. (Taking all the info from the BU with a grain of salt)

I was never able to be vunerable, but with him I slowly let down my walls. It was the final wall that was left, which I think my therapist and I both agree - emotional support &amp; feeling safe/secure, which I lacked in childhood. I guess he was never the type to see the details and voice them out when it's about me. Especially during the pandemic/stress, I lost 15lbs and he only noticed/mentioned it when someone said something infront of him. 

So reddit, beside the commitment problem I have...was it entirely my fault that caused this breakup? I still love him even though he said some mean things during the break up but it's all true, can probably say I'm spinless. I made a choice to let him go so he could find happiness at the cost of my own and didn't want him to put his life on hold for me. I know, I shouldn't be hopeful but I still would like to work things out with him..even though he's with someone new..",0

It sucks. All of it sucks. But you can do this, you deserve a safe and happy life.",0
370,I left my abusive ex boyfriend today for good. He’s someone I never want to encounter again after all our legal shit is over with. This big weight is off my chest.,0
371,"So my ex broke up with me because she needed to ""work"" on herself when she had a family crisis and I told her that I'd still be there for her and that no matter what I'm not just gonna leave her side. I later found out she moved on a week later to who I thought was my bestfriend. I found out that they were flirting with eachother the last week we were together and she moved in with her other ex to help raise his kid. I know she was a pos, but I cant get over her and i still would take her back. I just dont want her to get hurt even though she basically spit in my face. Why cant I get over her? This was my first ""actual"" breakup too and that dosent make it better. The whole relationship was me making sure she got the support and help she needed to be happy. We only argued over her exes and her canceling things on short notice alot. I just want to know what I did to deserve it?",0
372,"Good Morning ladies! I am a survivor! 
When I left, I was afraid because I was threatened, if I did not return, but I knew if I didn’t fight for my life, my daughters would not fight for theirs. I did not want to continue to expose them to anything that would be hurtful for them. 
“They were my motivation. “
I Thought I would never marry again. 
20 years later, I have been happily married for 12 years. We hold one another to high honor. We don’t disrespect one another, call one another names, argue or fight! It’s pretty amazing. All I can say now is thank you Lord for giving me the strength to leave and know I deserved more.",0
373,"You will never forget and simple things will trigger you but knowing I never have to go back, I believed I was strong for been able to deal with it. I was strong the day I left. I ran while he was at work and I can have nothing, I can have less than nothing but I will decide my future and I am strong and I am happy. I have ptsd and I even sleep with the light on at 40 years old but he has no power over me and that in itself is something to celebrate..",0
374,GBV is not only about women and girls its also affecting men and the boy child. In most cases they dont open up . Men and boys need to be educated about their self worth and values.This will make them respect themselves and the opposite sex,0
375,"He's hit me before in the past. Maybe I was being a bitch, but then he raised his hand at me as if to hit me, and I flinched rrally bad. Then he laughed at me amd called me a bitch",1
376,I know there are shelters for domestic abuse victims but I have a dog. I don’t have much money since I’m in school. Does anyone have any advice on how to get away when in this circumstance? I feel stuck and am mostly staying because I have no where else to go.,1
377,"so just a backstory, i met by now bf when i was 16 online, he was 20 at the time
 
i was not clear about my age from the start and he thinks i turned 18 last year, im actually 17 and i turn 18 this year

it has been almost a year and i havent told him, i feel like i cant because he might hate me
i feel so bad for lying to him, and he still doesn't know, i have no idea how to tell him
i know he doesnt deserve this but i love him so much and i wasnt even planning on getting into a relationship but here we are

any advice?",0
378,"The cycle of ongoing violence came out recently at her birthday party and was openly discussed with her friends.

At party said it was ""100% over"" and he is a ""fucking psycho"".

It also came out that she has a codeword to call for help from a friend.

She took him back a few days later and told me she knows it's ""toxic"", that she always questioned why women stay in abusive relationships but she loves him.

So I'm hoping that she is close to leaving him.  The fact she can see some truths but isn't yet ready to fully accept them gives me hope.",1
379,"Why am I such a fool? Emergency restraining order, sure, but I never press the charges. My friends and family are fed up with my stupidity for not putting him away. Setting here now, nose busted, throat to sore to swallow, house full of holes from a pry bar car window bashed in, and I set here doing nothing just glad to be alone for the moment. Why can't I take that step and remove him from my life?",1
380,"I used to be depressed many years ago and somehow, with time, it went away. 

I lived a really “good” life for a while, everything was going well for me, but now things are just normal (which I don’t hate tbh). 

I just feel really detached from my feelings and from myself lately…it’s not the same as before tho, that was much worse. 

I’d say it was worse because at the time I was a kid who didn’t know how to handle their emotions well and deal with all of the intrusive thoughts too. That itself led me to make a lot of mistakes which ended up hurting me and others. 

Anyways, this isn’t what I wanted to focus on, the thing is that lately (as I mentioned in the title), I’ve been facing some intrusive/sort of depressing thoughts. 


They’re mainly linked to some family issues I’ve been dealing with my whole life, but that don’t have that much of an impact on me anymore.

However, idk why but I keep having this sort of vision of my life, where I see all of the things that have gone wrong since I was born, even though I know I’m not responsible for any of them.

Still, I end up with this feeling of guilt where I can’t help but wonder how the lives of those involved could’ve changed if I wasn’t here.

When I was younger it wasn’t exactly like that tho. I used to resent those who brought me into the world for being so selfish, and would despise my existence/every aspect of living/myself. I mostly focused on me and got mad at everyone even though I knew I loved them.

In any case, I’ll just assume that something simply wasn’t resolved, now I’ve just got to figure out  what to do.

I thought I was alright but now I’m feeling a bit lost tbh.

Anyways, thanks for stopping by.",0
381,New to the group this morning and I’m struggling with feelings of guilt and like I’m betraying my abusive spouse by leaving. I just can’t go back but I don’t know how to express that to him or if I even should. I’m recently separated and just going through a rollercoaster of emotions. Any words of wisdom?,1
382,"Is anyone else just numb, like, they cant feel much or respond to much anymore? I cant rely on anger to make me leave because I dont really feel anything. If anger bubbles up it quickly disappears.The more beaten I am the more frozen I am. Got strangled again today, my body is covered in bruises all the time now, I can't walk properly. You'd think I'd be compelled to leave, wouldn't you?",1
383,We decided to make a break in our relationship and stay friends. I noticed that I act insane and get mad at the dumbest shit he is talking about whether to me or other people. I am sick of apologizing every single day for overreacting and being mad because he said something that I did not like.,0
384,"So I feel ashamed because I kept giving my partner chance after chance.
 We've had a chaotic and very fast relationship with multiple moves and i already have children and we have had a child together as well, in a small period of time. 
His outbursts and rants usually happen when alcohol and drugs are involved, but how many times can you forgive one person? 
Every time police are called he gets worse, everything is always all my fault, he won't take responsibility for his actions and hates being held accountable. 
I feel ashamed I stupidily let him back.
Yesterday was the worst, I was choked thrown and dragged by my hair. I did not retaliate as I feel he wanted me to hit back.
Police have put an order on so he cannot come back to the house. I feel relieved. 
What us wrong with me",1
385,"My husband's friend just lost his wife in a car crash. I didn't even know them that well, we only met a couple times, but I feel devastated--and like it shouldn't bother me as much as it does. Every time I think about her husband or two young kids I get a lump in my throat. Is this normal? I don't know why I feel this way. It's confusing and heartbreaking and I'm just feeling all the things.",0
386,Struggling so much and I really need support/advice on how to get through feeling so guilty. I feel so guilty for calling the cops on my now ex boyfriend but I know it needed to happen bc the physical abuse wasn’t stopping. I know I deserve better but the emotional attachment is still there and I’m hurting so much.,1
387,"After 17 years of hell, and six long months of waiting; today I will finally be a free woman!",0
388,He came over and demanded i let him in or he'd break the door down. I let him in and he proceeded to threaten my life & tell me a restraining order won't help me. There were no marks left and he took off before the police got here. I was scared by his threats and gave a statement. There were no witnesses and the evidence I have I have not turned over. Can they require me to testify? Does it get dropped due to insufficient evidence if I don't continue to cooperate? He's a narcissist & has turned it around on me. Like always. He's threatening to get a restraining order on ME. I was trying to let it go but now Idk if I have to go get 1 first to protect myself from having an unmerited restraining order on me.. plus all the threats to my life maybe I should. I love him tho despite all this. I had left him but started to rethink it. I fear a restraining order will make him FLIP. He's violated no trespass orders b4.,1
389,"Can't afford therapy but have been having these dreams, nightmares, feeling anxious and scared when stepping out, always on alert that someone is following me. Even after he's out of the home, I am scared and the abuse still continues. What would help?",1
390,"He choked me on April 1st. He constantly talks down to me. He threatens or beats me when I confront him about lies he constantly tells me. I found a hotel key in the car on Thursday he swears a friend left it in his car. He complains because I won't have sex with him because I have osteoarthritis in my right knee. He officially left Sunday, yet left a ton of stuff he says I can just throw it away. I dont understand why my heart is broken, I wanted him to leave, but I miss him and I'm 43 I'll be alone for the rest of my life. I can't stop crying what is wrong with me. Why do I love the man that almost killed me?",1
391,"t's not easy pulling yourself away from someone tou love , but stay strong and let him get on with it, it's hard but once you are finally free and look back and are out of his control and mind games you will start to heal and realise you are in the best possible mindset and more relaxed not walking on egg shells etc, I'm five years free and so happy and love being single xx",0
392,He’s threatening to kill himself. Threatened to jump off the balcony and was hanging off while our kids watched. Said if I call the police he’ll make them kill him. Said if I leave he’ll make my life miserable and then kill himself after he’s ruined my life. I’m sitting in my bedroom with the door locked with my kids on my lap. What am I supposed to do?,1
393,So the other day he pushed me on the ground grabbed me by my neck and was calling me hoes and the B word. What do you do if someone has 3 pending charges against you ? But the court dates keep getting pushed back due to covid. Do you leave ? Or stay until you get him to drop the charges ? If I leave he won't drop the charges. I have a Med Tech License and soon getting my CNA and Med Aide. I can't use them if im found guilty. All the 3 charges are against him. I can't take this anymore. I'm literally burning up on the inside. The abuse i can't bear any more but I love Healthcare I'm very goal oriented.,1
394,Well he gets home from work in half an hour and then I will be locked in my bedroom again because apparently I am a thief and a piece of shit because I took $50 out of his wallet to get my insulin and that was apparently his storage money to pay for his storage unit which he did not tell me at all and now I'm a bitch in a cunt and a thief and a whore and I have to stay locked in the bedroom while he's home with only four bathroom breaks a day until I come up with his money which of course I have absolutely no way of doing I don't know anybody he has taken all my friends and all my family from me so this is a real nightmare I don't understand how some men can be so cruel I would gladly work if he would let me I don't understand what he expects me to do he gets home very soon so I just wanted to at least let somebody know what's going on with me in case I don't come back out of my bedroom please don't judge me I have nowhere else to go I just wanted to tell my story for a minute,1
395,"Your enough,he brainwashed you,I know I went thru same shit as you,start loving yourself,make yourself feel good about you, I started counseling and I ain't going to lie I hated it at first but I made myself participate cuz I was simply tired of the merry-go-round,Imy body physically could not take it anymore,stress can and will kill you, I started working out,going places we said we was gonna do together so I show myself I am worth it, your a beautiful inside and out and your strength is inside of you that's what attracted the no good sorry ass individual liked about you is your strength because they are the weak ones hiding behind all faces they have.why because he wants what you have naturally and he can never get that because he's a piece of shit, degrading another human being to make himself feel good .grl stand up for yourself and love you, your worthy of so much more..",0
396,I'm living through so much abuse I want out. My husband is dying and he's still at it every day!!! Threatening me calls me name's tells me how dumb I am frightens me The mental abuse is unreal He has one foot in the grave and another on a banana peel and yet he continues.

My life is ridiculous. Know one will ever know the amount of abuse that I experience on a daily basis. I'm just hanging on.
