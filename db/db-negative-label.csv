GBV is not only about women and girls its also affecting men and the boy child. In most cases they dont open up . Men and boys need to be educated about their self worth and values.This will make them respect themselves and the opposite sex,0

"My new book is available on Amazon. I would like to share my story of how I overcame, what I went through in hope that it will be someone else’ SURVIVAL GUIDE.It started out with Mr. Prince Charming for the first 6months and gradually changed into Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde. This book is based on a true story about a powerful and explosive relationship! It contains graphic scenes of sex, drugs, violence and abuse. This book was written mostly from my journals. At first it was because I didn’t want to forget all the good. Later it was to protect my sanity. My abuser was extremely manipulating and kept me confused much of the time with mixed signals. (GASLIGHTING). Until now I had always believed that love endures all. I honestly thought my love would be the love that saved him. I honestly thought my love would be enough to change him. I thought that if I prayed enough, God would make him safe for me.",0
5 years ago my husband at the time broke in after years of abuse I left him he broke in and drug me through the house by my neck when my daughter tried to help me at 5years old he shoved her into the bottom of the couch I called the cops before he broke in so he made me call them back in belief that I would tell them it was false alarm I screamed out my address while he was wrestling with me to take the phone I still to this day can't believe my kids and I made it out that day thank you Macomb county for helping and the 911 operator for having the memory that she did and my baby is being diagnosed as autism spectrum so he assaulted a handy cap child that's why I got that jerk 4 and a half to 20 years hope he's having fun in prison,0
..if we continue to be silent the abusers win....we must bring to light.....the TRUTH behind domestic violence....we are the voice....and only together can we take a stand and change the system to actually protect the abused and make sure the abuser is held accountable for his actions....hate breeds hate....what are your children learning from both parents..... Scream your stories people.....from the top of every mountain...I will gladly stand by your side and hold your hand.....,0
"Why leave? For moments like these I can smile and laugh with no eggshells to walk on. Not waiting for an ass hole to blow up, name call, or lay hands on me or threaten my family. Or ""fucking stupid bitch. Why would you let them draw all over you?"" My son (not photogenic today) and grandsons just laughing that deep belly laugh. Just absolute, pure happiness.",0
"Ladies, if a person lays hands on you, go to the ER immediately. The hospital will contact the local police. This goes a long way in prosecuting the abuser. To do nothing, is letting him get away with it. If you can't take yourself to the hospital for whatever reason, call an ambulance. It is VERY IMPORTANT TO GET MEDICAL DOCUMENTATION.",0
I've been in a similar situation! Cheater is going to cheat and there's nothing you can do to change that.. My ex hubby kept cheating on me.. Found out he was bi polar... Couldn't handle the lying and taking my money... You're to beautiful to worry over him. You got this! Find something to distract yourself craft etc,0
"t's not easy pulling yourself away from someone tou love , but stay strong and let him get on with it, it's hard but once you are finally free and look back and are out of his control and mind games you will start to heal and realise you are in the best possible mindset and more relaxed not walking on egg shells etc, I'm five years free and so happy and love being single xx",0
"I'm at the point where if God said I had to choose between death or getting back with my ex, I would be like... Well Lord, can I get a couple of days to say goodbye...I love it here. It took a while but thank God I'm here",0
"After 17 years of hell, and six long months of waiting; today I will finally be a free woman!",0
First. Take a breath. None of this is your fault. So what if you spoke up. That’s fine. You are allowed to do that. It’s perfectly normal. What is far from normal is him busting your head open. Glad he is in jail. I hope someone busts his head there. Zero sympathy. I am sad that your girls are crying. Just give them a hug. Tell them tomorrow is a new better day. Be kind to yourself. You are worth so much more than this.,0
"He's petty, hateful, angry, dishonest, and dangerous. At 65 he is on parole, living with his mom, worked 1-week since getting out of prison in April and got fired for yelling at his boss, and has literally zero friends left.
Please know it's not worth going back. They do not change for the better. Their circle just keeps getting smaller and more hostile as they lose person after person.
I believe in you . Stay strong Queens",0
I'm so glad there's a page for us that have been domestic violence I've been through domestic violence relationship for 17 years thank God I'm out of it now I'm here to help others it will help others out before they get in the same situation I!! Or as I call them words of wisdom!!,0
So this morning I took a boxing/kickboxing class for the first time.. the whole time I just pictured my ex face and let me tell you it felt Great!!! I couldn’t stop punching and kicking.. it was so therapeutic! I thought you ladies would enjoy this!,0
"I finally got to the sheriffs department and filed to have him served divorce papers!! 
I’m so excited to drop any connection to his narcissistic ass, tell HIM what’s going to happen for a change and make him pay to help support his children without him forcing me to return every dollar! 
I’m so much stronger than I thought I would be before I left. 
I went from not knowing if I’d live through the night to being in my own house, I have a man next to me who would do anything to take care of and protect me, we have a baby on the way now and we are looking for a property to put a house on! 
I’m proof that there IS life and happiness beyond the misery, you just have to get out, and stay out. 
I will spend my life helping other women do exactly that and teach them how to help others.
In the meantime, I’ll be planning my divorce party!!! ",0
"Good morning 
How do you all feel they left the narc? I haven’t been with him since 2/2020 & it feels excellent to be in a place of peace. I’m no longer stressed & depressed worrying about what behaviors, mood,  &/or toxic traits he’s going to display for the day, night, or next day. The best thing I did was getting the narc out my life & off my back. My support & encouragement to you all is find a way to leave someday trust me you can live better & survive without him dragging you down to the ground in despair. Rise up Queens",0
"I’m slowly geting back to the way I use to be, I’m feeling more confident than ever and started enjoying things what I used to do, always love yourself and be yourself and yes time is a healer but the worst mistake you can do is go back as trust me it’s a vicious circle and you need to break free from it in order for you to start healing, going back will only make the healing process harder and trust me they can love bomb ya just don’t knowledge it as they NEVER change and people going through abuse, I know it’s hard to break free but remember there is support out there and don’t feel isolated as that’s what abuser does to us to make us feel alone and damage our souls and confident. Keep strong and keep safe beautiful peop",0
"I FINALLY, after a year and a half, got my court order of protection!!!! He tried to call me crazy, he delayed the hearings, he made me go through a deposition. He tried to wear me down and just give up, but I refused and am now protected and don't have to go through court hearings any longer or be as worried about my own safety!!!! 
It sucks. All of it sucks. But you can do this, you deserve a safe and happy life.",0
"3 years ago today he whiplashes & strangled me in front of my children and his youngest child. 4 children witnessed the abuse. I had escaped 10 years of abuse when I finally realized it was a life or death situation. I slowly started towards the light. I’ve come so far & still have quite a journey ahead. 3 surgeries, fusions, yes that monster caused severe issues in my spine. I’m now fused in my C6-7 and my Si joints. Pharmaceuticals were his weapon to aid in destroying me. Tearing me down every day. I gave up and gave in. I was completely numb. 
3 years ago today, I decided to take my life back. To go within and heal. I decided to face my demons and be kind to those parts of me that needed intense love and understanding. I needed to nurture myself. Choosing this path has not been easy…but it’s been worth i",0
"Looking for recommendations for books on healing from abuse.  I already know about Lundy Bancroft's ""Why Does He Do That.""  I'd prefer books that aren't based on religion or prayer.  Thank you in advance.",0
"After i got out of the situation, things with my bank account got wonky and i was almost ready to go back to him. 
But I remembered all the support my true loved ones gave me. I couldn't let them down. My obligation was to myself to keep myself safe, but I owed them that courage, too.
It's been almost 2 months and I am single and focused and thriving on my own. Keep your chins uo, my beautiful friends. We can do this.",0
"Hit my one year mark of having left. It hit me like a ton of bricks I wasn’t expecting. Hate when that old trauma bullshit sneaks back up. But So thankful to be gone, healthy, and happy. Cheers to all you ladies who made it out and prayers and love to those of you still trying. ",0
It’s been 4 months since I left my three year on and off abusive relationship. I lost my baby at 21 weeks pregnant on January 28th from all the abuse and that was the last straw for me. I left a month later on February 28th. A blessing in disguise as much as the trauma from that has hurt me almost daily. But I’m finding myself again. I’m working crazy hours and rebuilding everything that was broken and taken from me. I am healing. I am growing. I am learning. Feels so good to finally be rid of that toxic evil demon! I know my worth finally. I deserve so much more than to be beaten and talked down upon everyday. I can’t even imagine ever letting anyone treat me like that again. This group has helped me so much so thank you ladies,0
"Couldn’t b happier leaving my abusive ex, feel so much confident and certainly ain’t gona let no one knock me down as I’m the type who always gets back up 10 times stronger , whatever doesn’t kills you makes you stronger, always stay positive in life and never settle for abuse as can be soul damaging aswel as physically, emotionally and mentally. Remember your worth more than that and going through heart ache ain’t worth loving them as it’s them who has literally damaged our heart and souls by there abusive ways. Always keep strong and always be yourself and certainly don’t change for no one",0
Finally a judge heard me and listened to everything provided my evidence went from 2 weeks of stay away order to now 2 years stay away order man this was worth waiting for. I got sole custody of my child for those two years. I am shooting my joy to others to show you all just keep the fight and your strength I know it’s easier said then done but you got to in order to come on top.,0
" I left my abuser at the end of last year, and I've noticed a lot of positive change within myself. I am more relaxed and aware of my surroundings, which has made it possible for me to be more considerate of others. When I was in the relationship I was mean, mainly because he wouldn't allow me to be otherwise in a lot of ways.
Every other aspect of my life is worse than when I was with him, and he's making my life a living Hell as much as he possibly can, but it's more bearable because I'm not with him anymore. It's a crazy concept, but I still prefer this life over the one that I had with him",0
"Good Morning ladies! I am a survivor! 
When I left, I was afraid because I was threatened, if I did not return, but I knew if I didn’t fight for my life, my daughters would not fight for theirs. I did not want to continue to expose them to anything that would be hurtful for them. 
“They were my motivation. “
I Thought I would never marry again. 
20 years later, I have been happily married for 12 years. We hold one another to high honor. We don’t disrespect one another, call one another names, argue or fight! It’s pretty amazing. All I can say now is thank you Lord for giving me the strength to leave and know I deserved more.",0
"I am 7 weeks no contact and I left him 9 weeks ago. This is the longest I have gone no contact. I’ve finally broken the trauma bond and I am so proud of myself. I am feeling so free and so happy . He put me through hell for 2 and a half years. I finally know my worth and I will never look back, only forward.",0
"No one truly understands what a person of domestic violence goes through on a daily basis. The mental anguish, broken heart, trust issues, the scars and pain. It will get better and better days will come.",0
"I LADIES,
In addition to growing up in a domestic violence home I have always wondered what can we have people from around the world do to break the cycle?  It’s very disappointing that the fingers are always pointed at the victims lacking the attention on the perpetrators and the surroundings including our history and even religion in some instances that have supported this kind of behavior since the beginning of times. So my question is, what can we do more to protect ourselves and demand better initiatives for victims. Do we need mandatory education for children on how to treat women? fight for policy changes and greater sentences for perpetrators, ??????? What would be a solution other than disappearing all perpetrators",0
"So today is his birthday.  He is still in jail.  It’s been three quiet weeks.    
  For the birthdays and holidays he has ruined.  I’m honesty glad he is sitting in jail on his birthday.  He can’t be at the bar getting drunk.  Bad mouthing me.    Or contacting me saying how much he loves me.   When I knows he does not.   
    I’m glad he is in a miserable damn cell.  After everything he has done to me and my family.   
    Bitchy of me yes.  But at this point I don’t care.",0
Years of abuse and depression took a toll on my teeth. Today I didn't just get my smile back. A part of me that has been gone for over 20 years came back too! My life has only improved since I ended the abusive relationship that took so much from me. I did this on my own. I set a goal and I stuck with it. Please don't ever give up on yourself!,0
"I feel really low lately. I'm 26 yo female, and I just feel like I'm just here on this earth without having asked to exist. Not wanting to.  
I hate myself for having certain people in my life, keeping certain people in my life, ever having some people in my life, the way I am at work, the way I am at home, my inability to guide myself through life, my hostile attitude and anger management but also my quiet anger in public. I feel like people walk all over me. I have much to be grateful for like parents who support me, dogs, nice housing because I live with my parents...which makes me hate myself that I feel so sad and empty all the time despite having all those mentioned to be grateful for. 
I can't settle on a career, I've been in school nonstop since kindergarten, and ive changed from veterinarian to PA to RN to now just wanting to quit everything. Now I have a biology degree and work in a lab while in nursing school but I'm not happy. I wouldn't say I'm doing particularly well in nursing school either nor am I enjoying the idea of being a nurse. I want to live out my life with little consequence. Give dogs a home and take care of my parents until my time comes. I'm essentially doing what I'm doing for monetary stability in order to do the above. But I lack friends, direction, and passion in my life. I guess as opposed to the average late 20s post grad. I also have this debilitating inability to let things go... past trauma, anger, sadness, bad people in my life 

TLDR; I'm lonely and lack direction in my life. I am unhappy going to school for nursing but scared to leave as I have no other goals. I'm working in a job using my first bachelors degree that I am unhappy in. I feel isolated and without friends and strongly incapable to connect with people at work or school. My parents are retiring and I want to get my shit together before they need me to support them in their old age.

Have you ever felt like this? What got you through? What would be my next steps?",0
"Is there anyone out there? I’m tired of waking up everyday to nothing. I’m tired being ignored and feeling like I don’t matter. For fucks sake, is it too much to ask for just to feel like I matter sometimes? It doesn’t even have to be all the time, just like once a month or something. 
I don’t know, I try to not let it get to me, and I do a great job at hiding all of my feelings and keeping this act up that everything is fine and I’m perfectly ok with the fact that I don’t matter, but sometimes it gets to me. I guess that’s what’s happening right now, it’s just getting to me is all. 
I know they say love yourself and all of that bullshit, but god damn. When no one cares, it’s hard to do that. Even the people that are supposed to care no matter what, unconditionally or whatever, your family, your parents. When they don’t even care, how the fuck am I supposed to care? I’m just a product of their stupid actions, an accident. Shit they remind me all the time anyways. 
They set me up for failure, then they blame me for being a failure. I mean it is my fault im a failure, don’t get me wrong, I could just keep pretending like nothing bothers me and I have no needs or wants or anything, and just keep going, or I could just give in and stop hurting every day. I just want the pain to stop really. I wanna feel accepted to someone, 1 person. It doesn’t take much to make me happy, really, honestly I’m super easy to please, but nothing isn’t cutting it anymore.",0
"I thought I had a handle of it. I was creeping away from the edge for a long time but the past couple months my head space has shifted and I cannot pull myself out of it for more than a day.
I keep putting everything I’ve learnt into practice. It makes me feel a bit better for a short time and then I find myself in this thought that it’s all fake. I’m not really happy if everyday I have to convince myself of it. I’m just fake smiling, pretending everything is okay because from the outside my life does look pretty good. So why don’t I feel that? Is that how the next 30 years of my life will be? Saying to myself every morning, “smile, life is good”. When do I start believing myself? I tried throwing myself into old hobbies, seeing friends, mindfulness etc. Yet the joy is only temporary. I understand we have to have bad days to appreciate the good but the balance is far off. 
I cannot work out what truly makes me happy. How do I want to spend the rest of my life? I feel like I’m trekking through thick mud with a smile on my face hoping there’s a meadow on the other side, but the horizon gets further away with each step.
I’m just struggling to see the point in it all. I’m not happy and I have no idea why or how to change that. I’m sick of faking my happiness. 
I don’t know how to tell my family because I can’t really put what I’m feeling into words. How do you fix something you can’t even explain.
It’s the cycle that wears me down. I’ve never been so tired. Thanks for reading. Just needed to get it off my chest.",0
"I feel terrible. Just like rubbish. As a useless and unnecessary thing. Why did she communicate so nicely and well with me for over a year, said that she wanted to meet, said come to study in my city, so we can see each other more often. And now, when there are 3 days left before my trip to visit her, she is ghosting me. I want to die, or just not exist.",0

"Everyday may depression and anxiety get worse where to the point I cant eat, sleep pr even do what i need to do, and my heart feels heavy very heavy like theirs a big burden inside my heart that makes me not to move or to lose interest in everything. 

Then my mom notice my behaviour so she ask  whats your problem, and she also say your too young to get problem or to feel depress, your not even starting to work. Then I feel like i gonna cry because i want her to hug me, to care for me, or to talk to her, but I can because of what she say, I can even say that  I feel like dying everyday.",0
"My family has been toxic to me for quite a few months now, I can't handle the hate and their hatred glance at me everytime they talk to me. It's not just their speech, it's their body language which pushes me back everytime.
I'm sharing this just because, I want to let it out.
This incident is when I was in 6th standard, like every other kid I wanted attention and quality time with friends and family.
At about 8pm I asked my mom if she wanna see a movie together, she denied so I started requesting her and maybe got my tears out because I was not feeling good either at school or at home.
This somewhat made my father decide to pull me from the back of my shirt and glide me through the back of the house getting scribbled on the ground, I was crying there was nothing else I could do.
My mom stood behind and saw what happened to me, he took me to the back of the house and thrashed me on the ground, the back street.
People usually spill alot of broken glasses on the back house  to prevent theft, so they all got inserted on my back and I still have the deep scars which didn't get fill up yet.
They both went inside leaving me there and my sister came to me crying.
I was in so much pain that I couldn't move.
Yea that's it, now when me and my sister have an arguement, she taunts me about how she should've never came to see me.",0
"So my ex broke up with me because she needed to ""work"" on herself when she had a family crisis and I told her that I'd still be there for her and that no matter what I'm not just gonna leave her side. I later found out she moved on a week later to who I thought was my bestfriend. I found out that they were flirting with eachother the last week we were together and she moved in with her other ex to help raise his kid. I know she was a pos, but I cant get over her and i still would take her back. I just dont want her to get hurt even though she basically spit in my face. Why cant I get over her? This was my first ""actual"" breakup too and that dosent make it better. The whole relationship was me making sure she got the support and help she needed to be happy. We only argued over her exes and her canceling things on short notice alot. I just want to know what I did to deserve it?",0
"The amount of pain is unbearable. The breakup happened because he didn't want to hold me back, he didn't want to influence my life decisions or be a bad influence on me. On top of that he has a lot of shit going on with his toxic family and can only just cope with his own mental health through unhealthy coping mechanisms (drink, drugs).

He said that I'm one of the only things that made him happy, that I deserve the world and so much better than him, but I was so happy with how thing were going before I was blindsided. I was finally working in my mental health issues in a way that worked, spending more time to myself and setting myself boundaries. Then this happened and as a result I had to transfer jobs to avoid seeing him all the time, losing the community I'd built there over the past 2 years.

We've hooked up and spoken in the month following it which delayed the healing for sure, so we chatted the other night via video call, confirming that we need to go no contact, despite how much we still care for each other. The pain is too much. I still struggle to understand why this has happened if I made him happy, if I gave him purpose. I can't cope.",0
"The person you are now and and the person you were when you broke up with me is not the same person that I fell in love with. I've heard many people say that the military changes you and makes you see life  differently. And I do believe it's true to some extent. But I don't think this applies to you especially since your job in the military isn't on the front line. You just started showing your true colors. You left me feeling worthless and made me feel like I was never gonna be enough for anyone. You made me feel like I will always be replaceable when I found out you got into a new relationship just a few months after you ended our relationship. 

I noticed that you have never really loved yourself and you seek validation from others. You might think (and I also thought this for a while) that you are doing way better than me because you are in a new relationship and because you are doing better financially than me at the moment. 

But no, I knew that was false. You can have all the money in the world and have all the relationships/hook ups you want, but we both know that money can't buy happiness and as long as you continue to seek validation from others, you will be in an endless cycle of misery. I know I may not have a lot of money and I'm still single (and I think I will be for a while as I'm not desperate to be in a relationship and because I'm very anti social), but I know I never have to seek validation for others because I have always loved myself for who I am.

Now I know that it's not that I was never enough for you, you just never appreciated anything that I've done for you. Because of how I much I missed you, I was tempted to get into the casual dating/hook up scene to fill this void but I resisted because I'm strong and that lead me to know my worth. And I'm no longer gonna let anyone determine my worth for me.

You might say that you're too busy working on yourself to notice if I'm doing better, but we know that's false. We both had to work on ourselves and rushing into a new relationship leaves no room or time to work on self improvement. Im not saying you are the only reason that lead our relationship to failure because I know we both did mistakes. But I actually have the integrity to work on my faults and mistakes because I know that's the right thing to do unlike you. 

Ever since I've been working on myself, I finally knew what exactly are my morals and values. And I realized we don't have the same ones and they're not even close to being similar. I'm glad you put me through all this because it has made me a better person. Ever since you ended things between us, I was hoping that we will eventually date again. But now I'm learning to let go of that hope. My feelings for you have been diminishing more and more. I know that you still have feelings for me no matter what you say or do. Hopefully they will perish soon. And why you may ask? Because this is the end of our chapter and there will never be another one. And I know that because I know deep down that you will never change yours ways. I know I will eventually find someone else that will appreciate my worth. It may take years but that's okay because I know it won't be you. 

Thank you for helping get personal growth and character development.",0
"It hurts when the person you fell the hardest for decided to end it with you after 3 years. It hurts even more when he jumps into another relationship after only being single for one month with the girl he used to complain about being so annoying.

I don't know what I did to make him hate me but it feels like whatever it was, I'm being punished for it now. 
You told me you feel like you can't be happy or content in relationships. You told me you weren't looking into having anymore kids or getting married. One month after saying those words, you jump into a relationship with a girl that has a baby. Makes so much sense. I don't know what I did to deserve being lied to instead of just saying you didn't have feelings for me anymore. And it honestly makes me wonder if she was there BEFORE we broke up..or if that was the real reason we did break up. 
I honestly don't think I can take this pain or overthinking anymore. Hopefully someday I'll be able to let go, but today is not that day.",0
I recently broke up with my boyfriend and i feel horrible. I messed up really bad and i keep thinking back to how i could of done things differently and what i should of done differently too. I keep randomly remembering all the things we did together and the time we spent with each other. It hurts like crazy and i always think about the past decisions i made and what i should of ended up doing but didn’t. Its eating me up inside and i miss them so much but i also just wanna forget about them. Idk what to do about it.,0
"The thing about Real love? Is that it can never hurt. Only our bad experiences…our worst trials. Make love sometimes appear the worst. Love was never meant to be a game. Never supposed to make us cry. But when one abuses our love and betrays us? Our hearts want to give up the fight. When love is abused…and trust is broken like a seal. It is the pain that blinds us. And make us wonder if true love is even real. When our love for the one in the past was only left to wither….it is the rejection we feel that makes us cold and bitter. But the one that chooses to look past the heart in the very face of pain? Is indeed the one who knows love is true. And this truth is how we begin again. Don’t ever think that love is the reason for your pain. Love will never hurt us. It was never meant to be a game. 



As a female…I know sometimes it feels that every man will hurt you. And no man will treasure your heart. But I believe that not all men are the same . Men have been hurt by women too. Not all women will break your heart. A soul that will cherish your heart no matter what. This is the love I wish for. And you wish for it too",0
"I'm on day 3 of this break up, I started to feel better last night but this morning I haven't stopped crying 
I think a part of me thought he would have come back, said he misses me and wants to get back together. But he hasn't, and it hurts so fucking much. I can't deal with this, I feel like screaming and tearing my hair out. I want him back so badly. How can I function without him??? I have no one",0
"How do you cope with the fact that someone you were so in love with and cared for never really gave a shit about you?? I believed everything he told me about how special I was, and how he’s “never felt this way before” but now his actions prove he doesn’t care about me in the slightest. I’m trying to not take it personally but I don’t know what I did to make him care so little about me now. He’s discarded me like it’s nothing…and now I’m left looking in the mirror alone thinking “how could he treat me like this, what is wrong with me” 😓 I saw the way he looked at me, the way he held me, the things he said. Could they all have been lies? I just don’t understand",0
"How do you shake off the feeling of wanting them to come back. How do you 'not miss them'. I really wanna forget about him, but I just can't. He was all I had and now he's gone, I seriously don't have anything left. Any tips on how to move on from a breakup?",0
"It's going to be 3 months in 3 days that we've been broken up and no contact. Just need to get this off my chest

Everything was happy with my ex (dumper) during the 10years, even though we see each other once a week and some weeks 2x. I know it isn't much but during those years I had to look after my grandparents (dementia, one after the other), going to school, going to work etcetc, you know be an adult and earn money. 

When the pandemic hit and studying for 3 exam my mental health went down hill. The pandemic pretty much forced me to slow down in life and my mind was able to wander/think. My ex never seen me so down before (word for word), he did the minimal comfort but something in me wanted more but I didn't know what it was. Prior to the breakup he wanted to move our relationship to the next stage in life - marriage. When he mentioned it, my anxiety/panic shot up like a missle. I was scared, I couldn't entirely pinpoint why I'm scared but I think it was because of my mother (brief: mom doesn't like my ex, dated behind her back, had childhood trauma - emotional neglect, raised to be independent, can not be vulnerable to anyone, people pleaser etcetc).

Prior to the break up, I told him I was in the process of seeing a therapist to see what is wrong with my mind, why I'm scared. I do see a future with him, living in a house with white picket fence with our child running around in the backyard. To be honest, at the beginning of the relationship I never had that fear..probably I subconciously changed during those years being together. After trying my best to explain and articulate my feelings - in his head, he probably thinks I've been stringing him along all those years and treated him as a second options. Which isn't true at all, I poured my heart, soul, body in this relationship. He said because I was scared of my mom and unable to stand by his side, he will find someone new. He wanted me to say something for him to stay in the relationship, but I respect myself to not beg and give empty promises...so I let him go. A little bit after a month he found someone new and made it official in all social media platform (I have him muted). Not sure if it's a rebound because he said he didn't even think of breaking up with me a week before. (Taking all the info from the BU with a grain of salt)

I was never able to be vunerable, but with him I slowly let down my walls. It was the final wall that was left, which I think my therapist and I both agree - emotional support &amp; feeling safe/secure, which I lacked in childhood. I guess he was never the type to see the details and voice them out when it's about me. Especially during the pandemic/stress, I lost 15lbs and he only noticed/mentioned it when someone said something infront of him. 

So reddit, beside the commitment problem I have...was it entirely my fault that caused this breakup? I still love him even though he said some mean things during the break up but it's all true, can probably say I'm spinless. I made a choice to let him go so he could find happiness at the cost of my own and didn't want him to put his life on hold for me. I know, I shouldn't be hopeful but I still would like to work things out with him..even though he's with someone new..",0
"My fiance left me 6 months ago and it was all my fault. He wasn't showing me any attention no more and I have a long history of depression. I turned to alcohol and party drugs (mainly cocaine). Every chance I got, I partied and he went fishing or camping.  I suggested a break, just to give us space away from eachother,  we were young when we met (me 19 and him 22) and we had spent 6 long years together. 

But it seems he prefers his peace away from me and has decided to lock me off and be very cruel with me. He wants no contact and from what I've heard from him he has nothing bit hatred towards me.

But its like he's ignoring all the good times, we travelled the world together and I don't see how he can just let that go.

Since the breakup I've done everything to numb the pain. Drink, drugs, sex with other men. Obviously not working  

Sometimes I'm just hit with a sharp pain when anything reminds me of him. 

I just want to die . I wish I could wipe any memory of him and move on with my life.",0

"I’m starting my junior year of high school this year and I’m not really too excited about it. my freshman year was pure fucking hell!! my sophomore year was alright though because of COVID and had to do online classes..for 3/4 of my freshman year the anxiety was too unbearable that I skipped class and went straight to the bathroom for all 8 periods. my anxiety is like this my heart starts beating fast, I can’t walk straight, my eyes start to get droopy, etc, I asked my mom and dad if I can do homeschooling but they declined FUCK. I only have like 1 month left until school starts and I’m really considering suicide, I’ve been thinking about suicide everyday for a couple of months now, nobody in my family knows that I have a big anxiety disorder thing and I’m depressed out of my fucking mind, because of this fucking anxiety thing god gave me..because of this thing god gave me I’ve forgotten all my skills and all the things that made me unique, I’m just nothing, if I’m planning do commit suicide I would want a slow death like bleeding myself out. I would also love someone to beat the shit out of me until I’m dead but nobody would want to do that to me. this is only a small percent of what I experience. my emotions are not reaI, I have fake emotions, it feels like god is playing with my fucking mind, I just want to have real emotions, but depression and anxiety are the 2 only really emotions I can feel",0

I am Proud of YOU  
 you struggle, like we all do with thoughts of suicide and or dying or harming ourselfs to get through the day, you are not weak for thinking about it, you are not weak for considering it, you are STRONG for still being here, you are STRONG for still hanging on and though i dont know you or what you are dealing with, i dont know if there is a chance for it to get better one day or not but i hope it does, i hope you all find that happiness that makes you hang on for just a day longer, and then again tomorrow and the day after. many people wouldve probably broken if they went through what you are going through right now so be proud that you have made it so far, and even if you are not

Well there is hope out there or i got extremely lucky.

I know money isn't everything but we all need it to have a better life and improve ourselves.

I’m scared of the future and what it holds for us moving forward. But if nothing else, please know I love you so much. I know you love me and I am so lucky to have met you. Please take care of yourself. All I want is for you to be happy.

"My boyfriend and I celebrated our one year anniversary a week or so ago and he finally told me what he got me. 

Our whole relationship I've raved about Star Wars and how sexy lightsabers are, and I guess he remembered all those conversations!

He told me tonight that he'd ordered me a lightsaber and it might take a while longer to arrive, and I swear, when he told me I nearly cried. 

I've always wanted a sword and when my grandparents gave one to my brother, I was salty, but now I'm going to have a whole ass lightsaber!

I love this man so much, and I can't say it enough, I've already told all my friends but I just needed to tell the world how much I love him.

"I had a really bad day. I won't go into the details because they're irrelevant, but the torment didn't stop all day. There was nothing my boyfriend could do to stop it.

At night, when I was all tucked into bed and ready to sleep, he was next to me. I was feeling so bad after having a bad day that I broke down just as we were about to fall asleep. He sat upright and I thought he was annoyed with me, that made me cry a bit more. He sat cross-legged, took me by my arm (I was facing away from him) and just said ""come here"" in a soft whisper.

I sat on his lap, wrapped my arms and legs around him and cried. It was a chilly night so he wrapped the blanket around the both of us and slowly rocked back and forth while rubbing my back slowly and giving me light/soft kisses here and there. At one point he whispered ""cry your heart out if you want to dear, ive got you"". And I did, I cried quite a bit but it was okay, he was there, rocking me back and forth gently in his embrace, reassuring me and giving me soft kisses throughout.

After I was done, I felt so much better. I was smiling and giggling a bit too. He gave me more kisses, quickly ran his fingers through my hair, smiled and tickled me too. It was such a nice feeling after crying so much that my eyes felt sore. He cuddled with me to sleep, making sure I was okay. 

I'm so grateful.",0
"We have all made mistakes in relationships. Toxicity is sometimes not ingrained with yourself. Having ever been jealous is normal and you shouldn't feel guilty about it. 

Every misstep we take in a relationship, inevitably gives us the opportunity to grow, mature and improve for that, or for future relationships. 

Do not be so hard on yourself. You are not a monster. You just made mistakes, like any human being in the world. For future experiences, you will know how to react without affecting that person you love, and you will feel proud of yourself.",0
"I have had one of the worst experiences in relationships, always obsessing over people. This girl I met about in March-April, she's just...so good. She's exactly the logician I would want, the person who respects everyone, someone who's patient and understands my traumas. 
I feel something's different, I don't know what love is but with her I feel like I'm at home, it's exactly that kinda comfort. I don't obsess over her, I think. It's not the clingy/sticky situation where you wanna text someone all the time, it's more of a sense of freedom, even when the conversation dies out, it's not an awkward silence, it's more of a comfortable silence. It feels comfortable to have her around, and if we drift apart, it's not like everything's tearing apart, but I just pray for things to get back to normal as soon as possible and there's a slight discomfort..like when your heart feels heavy just before an interview? Kind of that.

I don't know what the future holds but I hope this turns to something beautiful and very stable. I think I love her, I've never really felt love so I don't know what it's like..but I'm happy and comfortable with someone so much, for the first time. Being with her, I almost got over all my insecurities, traumas, past fears and..found a love for myself as well that I never knew existed. It's just so motivating.

"I'm 22 years old. I'm young and should be living my life, make friends, finish university, or at least get a job. Except I'm not. I'm a recluse. A hikikimori if you will. I would be called lazy and weak, a lot growing up. Turns out I was depressed.

I've been struggling with depression since I was 14. It grew gradually like a parasite until I was 17 and dropped out of college because I couldn't live through another day of dispare. I used to self-harm. I remember telling my mother I wanted to die on my 18th birthday. 
I got help by myself. GP visits, medications and counselling. 
But now, when my younger sister whos 14, who went to the emergency room after swallowing around 10 pills of paracetamol, she got all the help she needs now; teachers, social workers, and my mum who buys her anything she wants. All I have is a box in my room to hold my stuff. And eventhough I could do the same, tell her I want this and that - we don't have a lot of money. We live in a council house. Sometimes we don't have enough to pay certain bills and food. And yet, my sister gets the new Jordans and causes a riot when she doesn't get to go to town with her friends. 

I got upset and mad about this. Why my sister get everything handed to her when you know she's self-centred and materialistic when me, at the same age would have mental breakdowns alone in my room. 

I'm not mad at my sister. I'm frustrated when I try my best for the family. Being the emotional support for my single mum, helping to take care of my disabled older sister since my dad left when I was 7. Looking after and taking care of my younger siblings. All the while dealing with whatever I had in my head. To this day, sometimes I think I'm better off gone.",0

It took a while just for them to respond when I wanted to bounce back as friends.

I reassured them that wouldn’t be the case, that I valued the friendship, and that I promised not to read into things when we talk. I got no reply and it’s been a couple of weeks.  

Few things to be clear- I didn’t enter this friendship out of hopes of doing something more, the feelings just gradually happened.  Also, it was a casual “confession” where I said I’m interested in potentially something more but would be okay if it wasn’t mutual, it wasn’t like a big “I love you” blow out.  They said things wouldn’t change, but clearly they did and I feel I can only blame myself for taking that risk.",0

"Okay so TW: Self harm for sure. So I am getting over my self harming addiction. I’ve been cutting since I was 12 and I’m 19 now. The main reason I’ve been going back to cutting is because every time my scars start to fade, I panic and cut. Because I don’t want to forget. I actually like my scars. They show how strong I am. I’ve been talking with my therapist and she thinks I should find away to remind myself of it, like maybe a small tattoo. But I don’t want a tattoo, so I thought I would turn my razor blade into a necklace or a bracelet. I just wanted to know, is this a bad idea? I’ve dulled the blade down so it doesn’t cut anymore, so it’s safe. I put it on a chain and I’m wearing it under my sweater just to see how it feels. I’m not wearing it to be edgy or insensitive, but I think it helps me and it seems to be having a positive effect on me.

"About a week ago a guy on reddit, lied about his age, told me he was 17 and got me to sext with him. I was lonely and horny so I agreed to. I even sent him a recording of me moaning while I was touching myself. I showed him my face and a few hours later when I asked him to show me his he asked me whether I would be mad if he wasn't 17. That's when he told me his actual age. He even got me and another 15 year old girl to participate in a virtual threesome on discord even when i told him i was not comfortable with it and didn't wanna do it. About 2 days of explaining and arguing,  I told him to delete my recording, and then blocked and reported his account. He told me that he was sorry, and that he would stop talking to me and the other girlS. Later, the other girl, told me that he was asking for the recording of me moaning, because previously, he had sent it to her, even though she didn't ask for it. She's a nice person. I trust her. She asked me whether she should send it to him and when I said no she said okay. 


Im just annoyed and angry due to the fact that he lied to me. He told me that he would stop talking to me and the other (probably) underage girls. But he still talks to the other girl. She just ignores him. Im pretty sure he'd still text me if hadn't blocked him. 


I want this guy in prison. What he has been doing, is doing, is not okay, and I wanna put a stop to it. Problem is, there's a time difference of 15 and a half hours so he lives literally half way across the world. Im indian, and..from the timezone..Im assuming he's American. Also, I cannot tell any of this to my parents. I cannot let them know. Under any circumstances. So I need this to be done secretly. Should I send him a friend request on discord and talk to him about it? I cant just sit here knowing that he's out there still sexting talking to underage girls on the internet. Or can someone report him to the police and put him behind bars somehow? Without me having to get involved? I have screenshots which serve as evidence of his pedophilic nature. I just need someone to do it for me without me getting involved. What can I do?",0
"Some time ago I've realized that everything is pointless. Not in a nihilistic way, but more of just and open-minded realization. I've realized that everything is just a construct made by society and everything we were ever taught to strive for is actually pointless and empty.

Success is a very subjective idea but it seems like society keeps pushing a singular picture of it to keep everyone in check. Fame is an extremely abstract idea that I personally never understood. Money is well, a material item that get thrown around and as the saying goes, ""Money can't buy you happiness"" and I've experienced what it meant way too many times. Then my last hope which is people in general, like friends, connections, relationships and perhaps love has been shattered after being backstabbed, betrayed, abandoned, left behind and etc.

Being a former avid dreamer this realization of reality has shattered me and has left me as a shell of my former self. Every time I try to strive for a passion I have or something I would go ""Why am I doing this? It's just a waste of time. I can't get rich off of this and fame and influence is a lie so why bother."" or like ""Why am I chasing ""success"" I should just stay low and humble. Nobody cares about what I do."" and etc. 

It also ruined because well, I kinda wanted all that. I was a loser growing up. My entire pre-school and elementary years had me being the butt of every joke and I was always overlooked and underestimated. I was always the one that every one knows would suck in a performance task like let's say a dance routine or something. No matter what I tried to redeem myself always gets shot down and they magnify my flaws. Then when I got out of my shell in high school people just judged me and called me a narcissistic attention seeker or whatever which hurt me even more. All that has given me the drive and motivation to rise and seek great success in life. So when I realized how pointless and empty they actually are, every thing fell apart for me and I have been stagnant for years.

I have a lot of passions and fire in me, but after all I've been through I just couldn't follow up on my them anymore.",0
"Been feeling some mounting anxieties recently.

Everything is going really well - home life is great, relationship is great, savings are good, just passed my probation at work so my income is secured. For the first time in my adult life, everything is absolutely fine - and if I just gave myself some time, I'd be in a really comfortable position in life.

So of course now my brain is going into overdrive coming up with an excuse to be scared and worried about worst case scenarios.

I was so anxious about asking my workplace to extend my work from home situation this afternoon that I literally almost threw up thinking about it and had a full 15 minute cry.

Without going to the doctor and taking pills, what's a good way to deal with day to day anxieties?",0
"Hey guys,

So my boyfriend and I have been dating for almost a year now, and he is truly a gem. He has been sincere, is very honest, and always been there for me since the death of my father a year ago. I never have to worry about my boyfriend, i can trust him with my eyes closed. 

Anyway, he has an older brother who also has a girlfriend of many years. My boyfriend was sick one day and told him to get tested for covid, i messaged his brother that. He got really rude and i was like what personal problem do you have with me? Long story short, he said:

'My brother's only goal in life is to please you and do things to make you happy. He does not do anything else in life. he wakes up late etc. Leave him. Either he can be with you or be successful in life' 

Anyway i got really hurt and i told my boyfriend to act as if we've broken up and told his brother that too. Thats what he did, and then his brother messaged me:

' Thankyou for listening to me and leaving him. Please remove all of his friends too. You were not his first love, neither his last'

I am SOOO hurt. is this normal? I never did anything t hurt my boyfriend, Why did his brother want us to finish this? was he right?",0
"Basically me and my ex used to talk few months ago (we reconnected cause we dated ages ago but were moved on) until she wouldn’t even open my texts, even though I could see she was online. I would text her once in a while and she wouldn’t even open them. The third time I texted her “hey how you doin?” She told me to stop texting her.

It’s been months since now she texted me outta nowhere, at first she was like “what’s up with you?” And then told me how she felt bad for how she was with me and that she was just very busy and stressed with work and took it out on me. What is she trying to do? She didn’t keep the convo running too much, she apologised and asked what all I was up to and said “well it was good talking to again, I’ll see you around”",0
"Hi, I need some help with something that is killing me. I'm a 19 year old m who's been in a relationship with my girlfriend for the past 3 years. I've always known she's had these mental illnesses (depression, severe anxiety, ptsd, body dysmorphia) as well as being undiagnosed autistic ever since I met her, however she was on a track to being able to manage these mental illnesses better and not let them get the better of her, and I was helping to build her confidence and have the ability to live as normal a life as she can.

For backstory, before COVID she used to struggle with catching public transport, to which I helped her catch her first ever train into the local town centre, she struggled with eating in public restaurants, to which I brought her to a quiet restaurant for one of our first dates to help her get more comfortable. I was so in love with her and I was happy to see that she wanted to make an effort for me, she wanted to live a normal life with the person she loved.

When COVID hit and we went into lockdown, she started to become much more worse with her mental health. I was furloughed, and in order to keep her company whilst we weren't allowed to mix with households, I decided to move in with her. We spent the first 2 months happy we could spend all of our time together and not be apart, we baked and watched movies, played animal crossing together and I introduced her to Star Wars etc. Life was going well, but being in a lockdown for 6 months doing nothing had an impact on her. 

She then started having issues with her space around her, saying she made drastic changes for me and that she doesn't have anything of her own. I did what I could and moved my stuff into a spare room so she could decorate and rejig her bedroom. She became scared to leave the house on her own, and couldn't even put a toe out the front door without having a breakdown. She began self harming again and waking me up at 3am to let me know what she's done. She became so mentally ill that she has to claim benefits as her mental illnesses stop her from being able to work, and these benefits limit what we as a couple are able to do once we're legally joined together. Even if there was nothing wrong with me, my income per month cannot exceed £2000 a year, otherwise she can't get the benefits to support her.

We had to get her started on medication, and she was becoming better on it. The doctors however ceased all contact with her and didn't prescribe her with more meds, causing her to have major withdrawal symptoms and she ended up slicing her leg so deep that we had to call an ambulance. 

I think I may have PTSD from that day, as now I'm scared that she is going to eventually do something similar or kill herself. I spent more time in the past year being scared and worried, making changes in my life to make sure she doesn't kill herself. I'm scared to even be away from her at my new office job in fear that she's going to slit her wrists, or take too many pills. I've become exhausted, depressed, anxious and I've regained my old anger issues, I'm now addicted to nicotine because the smoking helps me with the stress. I think I am not in love with her anymore, but I still care about her deeply.

Just last night, she woke me up at 3:30am to say ""I want to break up"". I asked her why and she said ""You'll have a better life without me, I'm ruining your chances at having a normal life."". She kept telling me how I'm going to resent her at 40 years old and blame her on the fact that I never had a normal life. She said that she is eventually going to kill herself and doesn't think it's fair that I have to deal with taking care of her and missing out on finding out what my life could be like whilst I'm still young. 

I don't want to be the person who left a suicidal girl at the moment before she killed herself. I don't want to be responsible for causing her family a lifetime of sadness by not being there for her. I'm so terrified that if I leave and try to help myself, that she will end her life. She's not trying to emotionally blackmail me into anything, I know her and I know that she would do anything to protect me. But I can't accept the fact that she wants me to leave so I can be happy and she can die alone. 

Please help me.",0
"My friend invited me to a sleepover with another one of her friends last night. I first said I can come but won't stay the night due to plans next day. She asked what they were I told her and she suggested i either leave early in the morning or do my work online from their home and I accepted. The sleepover is tonight. But the thing is our texts have been a little weird and dry since 2 nights ago and I haven't heard from her today. I want to go for the evening but I'm not sure if should stay the night. Should I just tell her now that I can't stay the night for my plans next day, or should I go with intentions to stay but if the vibe didn't feel right make an excuse and leave?? What would my excuse be ?(I can't fake a family emergency and I feel like pretending to be sick would seem fake or they freak out too much cause of covid).

I keep not wanting to pack and I am so nervous about pulling this off no one can be home so I am pulling an all nighter to make sure i can hear when they gone and gtfo i just wanna throw up i have so much anxiety",0
"Need some advice. Me and this girl hit it off really good, we matched on bumble and began talking right away. She wasn’t comfortable meeting up at first but after a few weeks of texting we went out for breakfast back in April. After that she said she wanted to see me again so we kept dating. In early June she asked me if I wanted a relationship and she confessed she really likes me and really wants a relationship with me. I said yes that’s what I want and I thought everything is good. Lockdown hit Sydney and we kept seeing each other until early July, and she’s started going a little distant and I asked her if everything was ok. She said she’s second guessing whether she wants a relationship, she’s not sure if it’s her anxiety due to Covid (she’s got some prexisting conditions so I can see her worry) or if she actually likes being with someone. She said she has strong feelings for me, loves doing stuff with me and spending time together but isn’t sure. I said I’m not sure what to say but instead of ending things if you have feelings for me we should at least try? She expressed she wanted to try than just give up but she’s still a bit distant. We haven’t seen each other due to the lockdowns and her anxiety about Covid so I respect that. But I’m not sure what to do about her second guessing. I’ve noticed when I message her she takes a lot longer to get back to me than she used to, to the point of I respond to a message she’ll come online and then go offline, if I double message she responds straight after the second message. If I leave her on read cause her message is like the end of a conversation she’ll contact me later on. I don’t know if I’m overthinking all this cause of the lockdowns or she’s shifted her interest. But if she’s not interested she wouldn’t engage in conversation about her daily life? Not sure what to do.

Tl;dr not sure if I’m reading into things too much with girlfriend being distant or if things aren’t going right",0
"I used to be depressed many years ago and somehow, with time, it went away. 

I lived a really “good” life for a while, everything was going well for me, but now things are just normal (which I don’t hate tbh). 

I just feel really detached from my feelings and from myself lately…it’s not the same as before tho, that was much worse. 

I’d say it was worse because at the time I was a kid who didn’t know how to handle their emotions well and deal with all of the intrusive thoughts too. That itself led me to make a lot of mistakes which ended up hurting me and others. 

Anyways, this isn’t what I wanted to focus on, the thing is that lately (as I mentioned in the title), I’ve been facing some intrusive/sort of depressing thoughts. 


They’re mainly linked to some family issues I’ve been dealing with my whole life, but that don’t have that much of an impact on me anymore.

However, idk why but I keep having this sort of vision of my life, where I see all of the things that have gone wrong since I was born, even though I know I’m not responsible for any of them.

Still, I end up with this feeling of guilt where I can’t help but wonder how the lives of those involved could’ve changed if I wasn’t here.

When I was younger it wasn’t exactly like that tho. I used to resent those who brought me into the world for being so selfish, and would despise my existence/every aspect of living/myself. I mostly focused on me and got mad at everyone even though I knew I loved them.

In any case, I’ll just assume that something simply wasn’t resolved, now I’ve just got to figure out  what to do.

I thought I was alright but now I’m feeling a bit lost tbh.

Anyways, thanks for stopping by.",0
"Am I an ass if I don’t want my girlfriend to be in contact with her ex?

For some context before her relationship with him ( which lasted about 2 years on and off) they were childhood friends. They basically have known each other for 10 or more years. They grew up right around the block from each other and basically hung out all of their childhood. I believe he was also her first relationship. Fast forward to last week was her birthday which I expected him to message her about and then ask for updates on her. That day we drove about two hours to go visit her mother. She seemed like her regular self nothing out of the ordinary. I ended up falling asleep early after dinner while she was still awake. Fast forward to today I noticed she has seemed a little off lately and more reserved. Something just seemed off about her. 
I decided to check her conversation between her and him (both of us have given each other permission to go through another’s phone, we both know each others passwords). When I quick glanced through the conversation I noticed that they basically talked the whole day together on her birthday while I was with her over her mothers house. I also noticed that she was replying and texting him almost instantly. This is something that she never does especially whenever I text her and I know she’s on her phone. The conversation was pretty lengthy that first started with updates and then progressed into him stating they should meet up again at home (2hrs away). Which she agreed. Throughout the conversation there was no mention of me. No update on how her relationship in a new state was going. Just about her and how the dog we got together was doing. 
Fast forward to yesterday she was texting him about a vacation they had together in Dominican Republic and how much fun it was and how they should have just bought property there. Then they were going back and forth just remembering their vacation together. This is going on while she’s hanging out with me at home while we are both off from work. 
Basically throughout the relationship I have had to hear about this guy in some way almost everyday. Whether this would be about previous vacations they had, his family, or even his pets. Basically almost everything relates back to him with some variation of when Sebastian and I did…. 
She has had a few other relationships after that one and before us. I know that while she was on and off in a previous relationship before me, they started seeing each other again. Last time they were together which was about two years ago they were friends with benefits. 
Im just not sure if I’m over thinking all of this but I plan on talking to her about it. I understand that she has known him and had a relationship of some sort with him all of her life practically. I just don’t know what to think about all of this. I just wanted to get some neutral unbiased opinions on this from you guys. Take into account that my bias is definitely showing here and it just seems sketchy to me the whole situation. What is your advice and opinions?",0
My brother was beat up really badly almost everyday by an older boy in middle school. Like he would come home unable to lie down due to the bruises on his back. Now that older boy is a freshman at my high school. My friend’s boyfriend was caught vaping in class by another friend and they got into a fight over this as she said the person who told her threatened to snitch and it caused the two to break up. Then she lied and said the snitch was my brother’s bully. This ex boyfriend is drug dealer who has put one guy in the hospital. An eye for an eye or should we lie and just say my friend (his ex) is who saw him?,0
"To put it blunt i used to be a bad person, whether it was being a bad partner or me just being a bad friend i was a terrible person either way. Over the last year I've improved myself greatly and have a completely different mindset. But my guilt is still eating me up, to the point where i feel like dying. I've thought of seeking medical help but i don't know if it has gotten that severe. What should i do?",0
"[TL;DR] I don’t know what I am doing with my life and if things are going to get better in future .

So I am a twenty year old final year medical student, and I am going to be 21 years old in two days (it’s 19th august at the time of writing this post, my birthday is on 21st).
My problem is not very specific, so I’d appreciate any kind of help or advice.

Firstly I don’t think I am very passionate about medicine, I am fascinated by it but I think that if I become a doctor, I won’t be a very good one, because my score were pretty average throughout my MBBS and as a child I never thought I’d be a doctor, I always had something else in mind.
So that kind of makes me think what I am doing with my life, why am I studying something I am not really passionate about, was getting into medicine a good idea.
I do get motivated when I see a doctor treating patients but I guess that’s just me getting fascinated by this profession.

Secondly I am almost 21 and I’ve never been in a relationship, and up until last year I never actually even talked to a girl (because I think I am very introverted around strangers)

Last year in January a girl started talking to me, and I got comfortable with her pretty soon, and as you might have guessed I started liking her after about 4-5 months of talking, and at that time I didn’t say anything to her because I could tell she wasn’t interested in me but after an year of being friends with her I confessed because I could not keep it a secret anymore and she obviously rejected me. That broke me and I have three friends but because of this pandemic everyone is at their home and we are not talking to each other a lot, so I am feeling very lonely since then, I used to feel lonely even when she was around but in my mind I used to think that at least “she is around”, but now that she is gone, I pretty much have no one to who I can talk to.

So keep thinking if I’ll ever find someone for myself, because I need a lot of time to get comfortable with a person and get to know that person before I can start to have feelings and I guess that will be problem in future.",0

I’ve asked her questions about why she does it and if she will stop. And I don’t get any answers. It actually made me mad when I found out, how could such a sweet girl be doing that to herself? She is already very skinny and now she has started vomiting up her food. I’ve been thinking about this for a while now and I’ve decided to turn yo Reddit.

"At the end of last year I randomly sent a drunk, coked up text to my old boss. It wasn’t suggestive in the slightest. Just plain weird. My girlfriend then discovered those texts and was like: ‘WTF is this?’
It caused a massive rift in our relationship and has led her to be suspicious of other females, who aren’t family, in my life. I had never had any relationship with my old boss other than a professional one. Out of the blue and having not texted the old boss since that drunken night (close to 9 months ago), she messaged me saying she might have a job for me. I hate my current job and she knows that. My girlfriend knows that too and we have been discussing potential career changes. This job would be in the same industry. How do I broach this subject with my GF without her flipping it?",0
"So, I am the youngest in my immediate family. The oldest is my cousin who recently got married through a matrimonial site. But the thing is, while my uncle was making that site she was probably aware of it. 
My father today asked me to make one, as the second oldest sibling, who is my sister, just turned 27. I live in a traditional Indian family, so 25 above is the age where women are pressured about marriage. 
Last year my sister had a meltdown over the marriage conversation and so my father understood, or pretended to, and had stalled everything since then, but today he comes over to me, asks me to keep everything confidential and make her profile. It took my uncle 3 years to find my brother in law, so I understand that my sister was being a bit irrational before since it is going to take a lot of time to find anybody, but I firmly believe she should know about this. I tried to explain my parents the whole thing, that she should know what is going in HER PROFILE atleast, but they didn't want to listen and they started being melodramatic. Sort of the typical Indian parent thing if you ask me. They said they would let her know when they start finding suitable matches. (She will not be wedded without her and us knowing the guy, I assure you. She can very well reject if she doesn't like him, its just the profile thing) What do I do? Should I make the profile? I am a good secret keeper but a terrible liar. This feels like lying. 
About my sister's relationship status, in the beginning she seemed committed to this guy, but he was definitely not serious about her. I have talked to him casually on my sister's request (she is the type of person who sort of remains stuck on this one guy and tries to get him friendly with me.) and I didn't really like him? Throughout the last year, even though I didn't want to intrude, I couldn't help but see how she would cry every few months. It is/was (I don't know) a VERY on and off relationship. I don't even think she knows where this is going. Last year she told him that our parents and uncle are serious about the marriage thing but even then nothing happened. So I truly think she should move on from this guy. She gets really stuck in relationships no matter how undeserving the other person is. 
I could give her a warning, she would pretend she doesn't know about the profile, but if a fight occurs this might probably will get mentioned and then my parents will be very disappointed with me. 
Don't know what to do. Please help.",0
"Recently my girlfriend (19) went through my phone and found a photo of me (17) putting my arm around a female friend. She went through my phone and laptop when I was passed out. And she got insanely mad. I was mad at the fact that she went through my phone as she didn’t trust me.

She assured me she had nothing to hide and that I could go through her phone anytime. I did the same to her yesterday I found pictures and videos that she sent to her ex’s. She kept all of the chats with them. One video I saw was her getting fucked by another guy. I know she loves me so much and I love her so much as well. I’m trying my best to ignore and forget whatever I saw as it all happened in the past and I know she’s loyal. I can’t forget whatever I saw I don’t even know why I can’t. She’s a lovely girl I love her so much but sometimes the video just pops into my head and I start acting cold towards her. What should I do? I don’t want to hurt her by acting this way.",0
"So we've been playing together for a while now and he seems genuinely interested in pursuing something more than a friendship but I made it clear from the get go, that I don't date, even if it's long distance or whatever can come out of gaming together. I don't do relationships not even sleeping around because it's just not me and I'm okay with that you know. I just can't seem to open up to a guy in a way that would class as more than friends. I'm quite open but if I feel like they want more than being friends, then I shut off a lil.

I don't know how to feel about this guy because he flirts around a lot and it comes off as a joke and I rebuff it. I never flirt back with anyone and just joke back. I like the guy as a friend and he said the same too but sometimes I feel like he's really trying to get me to open up more and he'll bring up the possibilities of me being in a relationship quite often.

To be honest I thought he was either a 'nice guy' or an fboy from the first couple of times I met him because of the things he said but after getting to know him, it doesn't seem to be the case. I've watched movies with the guy online cause he suggested it and I didn't mind cause I didn't think much of it but in hindsight, was it something that could make him think that I'm interested in him? I mean he knows that I don't like men (not a man hater just had really bad experiences with men since a child till now and its put me off from wanting to date) and he's brought it up, so he's aware but am I stringing him along by wanting to game or watch movies with him? I genuinely don't think much of it and I made it all clear to him but I don't know what to do when someone wants me to open up to them in a completely different way. 

I'm not sure how to approach this, so just some insight into this will be greatly appreciated.",0
"I used to see my father as my hero, just like any other kid. As I grew up, I found out my mom divorced him because he cheated on her with several other women during their engagement, did drugs (sometimes leaving them out wherever in the house, putting me at risk for accidentally eating one), constantly went to casinos, went to jail thrice, and was overall an ass. 

I realized how he would always put his own child second to his own needs and egoistical self. He was a borderline uninvolved parent and put all the work on my mom for raising me. I cut him off because I knew it was for the best (especially after he made me pee in a bottle to hide the fact that he was still doing drugs [I was ten when this happened so I had no idea just how bad that was]) . Besides, I found out he never wanted to have a child to begin with. Nonetheless, the memories I thought were good ones with him stuck with me, like how he would call me his little monkey, buy me ice cream occasionally, take me to the movies, etc.

I remember when my mom was in the process of divorcing him, he would stalk her because he was obsessed with her, would use me as a way to get closer to her, and one time made a hole in the wall out of anger after she refused to call off the divorce. Yes, he was a bad person. 

Either way, I can't help but remember the ""hero"" I used to have. I feel so disappointed knowing that the moments I cherished with him probably meant nothing to him. I have a step-dad who treats me a lot better than my father ever did, so it's not like I'm lacking a fatherly figure. My mom is hardworking, stays healthy, and teaches me the right things, so why do I still feel this way? I had amazing grades in school, my group of friends, and led what many would consider a fortunate and happy life. I know my worth and know that it's best to cut him off and not contact him. 

I want to let go of my father completely but I can't. I want to hate him after all he did but I can't bring myself to do so. Why do I feel this way? What should I do?",0

"Hi everyone. For context, I am not in the US.

So, I am feeling overwhelmed the past days. I feel like my life is falling apart - work, finance, and family-wise.

I became unemployed 3 months ago. I was supposed to transition to another job, but for some reason, it did not happen. So I ended up being unemployed. I job searched for the past months but until now, to no avail. I sent lots of applications but only few responded - either I am not fit for the job or I am overqualified.

Problem is, my bills are piling. Loan collectors are calling me now, and even private loans from family and friends, they are asking me to pay (I loaned some because I became sick last March and needed money). I have a part time job but it is only enough for my daily needs. 

I am becoming overwhelmed and anxious. What made it worse was that my dad and I fought over this morning because he said I am 'useless'. They do not know that I am unemployed and I don't want to tell them because I would hear lot of painful words again.

I really do not know what to do. I wanted to run away. Today, I received many messages asking me to pay up and it increased my anxiety level. I really want to run away.

"Reddit, I’m a fairly successful woman in my early 30s and have quite a few friends and interests. But I’m consumed by regret and can’t break out of my obsessive, cyclical thought patterns.

Despite being fairly academic, I was really badly bullied at school and didn’t live up to my full potential. When it came to choosing a university, I ended up going to an ugly, unimpressive uni, the sort that people pull a face about whenever I begrudgingly admit I went there. 

By this point I had really bad mental health problems and ended up having some big fall outs. I ended my time at university completely miserable, friendless and filled with regret. 

My early twenties were a complete mess and centred around an unhealthy relationship. I got fired from loads of jobs, a memory which still makes me feel really anxious and insecure. I also made some stupid decisions, eg getting into debt, following said boyfriend to another country where I studied for a masters in a subject that was more him than me. 

When I returned, I started to get help, taking antidepressants and having counselling. I also started to get more relevant work experience and training and, at 26, finally landed a decent job in field relevant to my interests. Life has felt more solid since, but I feel very behind in many ways. I have also recently had to move back to my parents’ house because I was living in an unsafe flat-share and don’t earn enough to live alone. This situation has has knocked my confidence considerably.

I hope to move out again soon, and am grateful to have a place to go, but this isn’t how I saw myself at this age. I always longed to live somewhere far away from the place I grew up. I didn’t expect to be wealthy, but I thought I’d at least earn enough to rent a studio flat in a suitable area.

My life is okay on the surface, and I don’t want to sound ungrateful. But underneath I’m a broken mess, and constantly feel inadequate. I so wish I’d done better at school and gone on to study at a prestigious university. I wish I’d made solid friendships during those lost years. I wish my career had kicked off earlier so I could have travelled more and had a wider range of experiences.

I just keep thinking about all the time I’ve wasted over the years, time spent crying in bed or being too scared to leave the house. I get flashbacks all the time to when I would behave in a ‘crazy’, paranoid way when I was young and feel so humiliated. 

Every single day I wish I could go back in time and redo my life, lay a more solid foundation for the years ahead. Get help sooner so I could have made the most out of my youth. 

My discomfort is so strong that I find myself not wanting to have children because I feel like I am not ‘enough’. I feel permanently ‘stained’ by my past if that makes sense, and still bear very real reminders in terms of the amount of debt I’m still in.

How do I just accept myself as I am and move forward? I’ve tried counselling and CBT and nothing seems to work. I also don’t want to go back on anti-depressants.",0
"So I’ve been in a relationship for almost 4 years now and I am heading off to dorm nearly 7 hours away while my girlfriend stays and studies in our hometown. The problem is I love my girlfriend but I know I still have really deep feelings for someone else I have known since 2013. The girls I’ve known since 2013 (will refer to her as girl b to make it simple) was honestly the first girl I fell in love with  but as much I tried I was to nervous to tell her how I felt even though it was very obvious. We went to different high school and I decided to unfollow her on social media to try to get her off my mind but she never went away as I think of her everyday. As high school progressed opportunities came with different girls to have fun and even though I was interested I never wanted to use a girl it just felt wrong. So I decided a girl friend is what I need. In doing so I decided to start talking to a girl I knew had a crush on me and although I didn’t think she was perfect I decided that maybe if I took a chance in her I’d forget about girl B. But I knew in the back of my head when we started dating that I didn’t like her like I liked girl B but I thought with time I would start to have deeper feelings for her and in a way I was right but I also decided to break up with her. A couple days into the break up we got back together because I knew she genuinely loved me and I needed someone because I always felt alone. In the span of 3 years we grew so much together as I helped her embrace her voice and get out of her bubble and she did the same for me. Meanwhile girl b was always in my head, I could not go a day without thinking of her. Girl b and I were best friends but it always seemed like there was but more going some days and some day there was less. After got promoted to high school we didn’t really talk much and maybe that’s why I thought I could get her out of my head by unfollowing her but I guess I really hurt her although  she was the One that stopped texting as much; as we used to text almost every minute. I get that hurt her I just didn’t realize it at the time and I thought she didn’t care about me that much. She kinda grew to hate me but she also recently reached out to me after seeing me at a football game last year my heart dropped as girl b sat 3 row behind my girlfriend and I as my friend texted me saying that girl b wanted to talk but I had left to eat in n out with a friend because I knew she wanted to talk about the past. It even went so far that my friend took girl b to my house and demanded that I come out but I was eating at in n out they called my phone relentlessly as it made me lose my appetite due to how nervous I was towards confronting girl b. I decided to text girl b the next day and we both apologized and she said she just wants it all behind us now but I didn’t say everything I wanted to say. I’m now stuck with the decision of what to do. Do I tell my girlfriend everything and risk someone I have learned to love and lose the 4 years we’ve spent together? Do I tell girl b the truth and that I love her and I that I always have even though I’m pretty sure she no longer has feelings for me ? I’m going to be dorming 7 hours away from both of them do I just start my life over?",0
"So this comes with a little bit of a story.

I'm currently 22M, and my girlfriend is 24 and pregnant.

When I was 20, I was dating an extremely toxic girl whom I met when she was 5 months pregnant. I instantly had a crush on her and we started talking instantly. It was mostly over FB Messenger and snapchat. I was thrown off by the fact that some days she was super sweet to my, and literally over night she would ignore me, act like she hated me, and say she had a boyfriend now. It went back and forth switching every few days. 

When we became officially, she moved in rather quickly because her child had been born and she still lived with her parents. It's worth noting at this point that I lost my virginity to her so I became attached.

I worked graveyard at the time, and I still do. Come to find out that she cheated on me while I was at work almost every night with her Baby Daddy. I found out because he sent me screenshots mostly to taunt me. Like an idiot I let her stay and admitted it was my fault. We made up and it seemed fine until only a couple weeks after that when she started texting him using FB Messenger's secret mode(right next to me BTW) and snapchat. She did all of this blatantly and out in the open. She would claim it was just to maintain a healthy relationship with the guy for their daughter's sake. 

I started living in anxiety, stress, and just general unhappiness. I learned to look into every little thing to uncover the truth about it. Even something placed where it shouldn't be was a clue she had been cheating on me. Her not answering texts quickly enough was proof she was on the phone with him. It all added up and I was right. After a lot more of this life, I finally broke it off with her for good and started to heal. 

Right at the end of my healing process I met my current girlfriend of 1½ years. She's never been with anyone else and her family; childhood friends have told me the same. I'm her first for literally everything. I love her a lot and she loves me back. But lately I've been suspicious she's cheating on me mostly because I'm experiencing the same minute signs. She's not answering texts instantly, I'm not with her at night because I still work graveyard, and she's pregnant, about 14 weeks if it matters. She's assured me multiple times and I believe her in my heart and my gut. But the toxic relationship I endured still seems to be taking its toll on my ability to trust anyone.

How can I help get over this? How can I learn to trust my S/O more so it doesn't become a burden on her??

TL;DR: I was in a toxic relationship and got chested on with the girl her took my virginity and now I think my current girlfriend is cheating on me even though I KNOW she's not",0
We decided to make a break in our relationship and stay friends. I noticed that I act insane and get mad at the dumbest shit he is talking about whether to me or other people. I am sick of apologizing every single day for overreacting and being mad because he said something that I did not like.,0
"We know each other from 3 years, In a relationship for last 6 months. 

She has always been emotionally unavailable due to her rough upbringing. She does open up to me about how she feels about things and she says you’re the person with whom I have shared most of the things. 

But she never tells me if I say something wrong and will keep that thing in her mind. As an anxiously attached individual, I have a lot of trouble dealing with this. Moreover, I am very upfront and blunt about everything and tell her whenever I find something wrong.

She says she’s trying her best but she “wouldn’t promise”. I am always scared of this. I always think what if I say something wrong and I never get to know about that and she keeps that thing in her heart always and it keeps getting bitter and bitter. 

Has someone experienced the same? If yes please give me some advice on how to deal with it 

Thank you",0
"I love my girlfriend of 5 years but our relationship is textbook toxic. She insists on fighting about the most minor of things and then having lengthy conversations about it. Yesterday she literally spent the whole day mad-texting me for not picking up when she called me once the day before. Every time I checked my msgs, I found a new one from her that just made me so so angry. 
 I'm at the end of my rope and ik that i have to break up with her. Frankly, though, we're already in a very difficult situation with covid and I'm afraid to be even more alone. She's the only person i can see these days without having to worry because ik she takes all precautions. Any advice?",0
"Exactly what the title says. We went out for ice cream after a movie and it turns out he really didn’t wanna go. I had no idea as he didn’t voice this until later. He said I forced him to come and it upset me and I was hella confused. 
It ended with him telling me that it’s just something guys do. 
Things that they don’t wanna do to make the girlfriend happy. 
How do I proceed knowing this info? It’s never come up in 2 years. I’d have no idea he doesn’t wanna do things.. he plays everything as if he wants to do it.",0
"I keep trying to break off a friend who insists he wants to turn back time to what we used to be and insists on being friends, also exaggerates that he did a lot for me and it makes me really uncomfortable that he cannot just understand i dont want him in my life/i want to be alone. He keeps blaming himself when its not really his fault and i just want him to break it off with me because i just want to be alone. How can i convey this without making him feel he was at fault and make him realize its normal to feel like you want to break off friendships? Any advice would be welcome, thanks",0
"Hi, I'm writing this late at night because I feel completely hopeless, a few days ago I had an argument with my husband because he got very upset because a long-time friend spoke to me, that led to a dispute that continued for a day (of his part) days ago he told me that he had a slight pain in his friend so today he tells me that he thinks it is a sexually transmitted disease (he is a doctor) he says that he plans to sue me if so, besides speaking he told me that I was fat (I gained about 6 kilos in these months due to my depression) he told me that my feelings towards him were stupid, that he was no longer a little girl and that he had to mature (I am 20f) to clarify he has been the only couple of that type that I have had in my life and I have not had physical contact with anyone else.",0
"Because I am not happy with our relationship anymore. Our relationship isn't going as well as I'd like. Last Sunday we got together but I feel like there is no spark anymore. He can't genuinely make me smile even he's trying. And I feel bad for what I felt because I know this is not right. We almost 3 years in a relationship. I am not happy but it is hard for me to leave him or let him go. However if it is not going well for the both of us, I am thinking I should leave asap. It is tough, but getting out of it is I think the best for us if we can't be happy anymore. Should I?",0
I (f19) just broke up with my boyfriend (m22) of two years after I found he made a tinder profile recently. I looked at the profile and conversations really never got past the introductions but I couldn’t take it. I really do love him and want the rest of my life with him and he wants the same but I can’t trust him right now so I broke it off. I said there’s nothing he can do right now but haven’t completely closed the door on getting back one day down the line. What would you do if it was someone you truly loved?,0
My boyfriend and I have been together for just over a year. We have been having quite a few minor arguments recently. We had the chat yesterday about the best way to go forward. He wanted to go on a break for a couple of weeks to see if he misses me. We work in the same company so how do I act to get him to want to come back to me and is it likely when a guy initiates the break that he will come back?,0
"I’ve been very depressed,suicidal, and having panic attacks for the past couple months. He is the only one who knows what’s going on and he’s been very kind and supportive. I just feel like crap though and I feel like I should break up with him. I’m not good enough for him. And he shouldn’t have to take care of me. I just feel like at this point I’m going to actually go down this road and a very irrational part of me feels like breaking up with him and burning bridges will make my death easier for people.  I’m not as suicidal before. It’s been coming and going a lot lately but I still think he shouldn’t have to support me mentally and emotionally. It must be exhausting for him.",0
"I don't know what to do, I feel lost. 

My partner and I are in a long distance relationship and I really do love him so much. I'm just struggling hard to stay positive for us to close the distance; Every option involves some criteria that doesn't apply to us, and I honestly just feel hopeless.
The other option is getting married soon, but I've told him I don't feel ready for that (mentally I need to mature more).

Its getting too much to handle and I need advice- should I persuit the relationship or leave now?",0
"It’s a mess and hiding all of this is very hard, I want to come clean and feeling like I’m committing a crime for being in love with a woman. 

My parents are pretty religious but my mom is lowkey gay and doesn’t know it/want to admit it because she loves god too much. Her and my dad are divorced but are on good terms so I can tell them together at once but how.... I’ve been trying to tell them but the words won’t come out. 

In 5 months we’re going to move in together. 

My last relationship last 4 years and it was with a boy, it was first relationship ever too and he was so toxic and abusive to me and it was impossible to break up but once I did it I found myself super attracted to woman and I have no sexual feelings towards men whatsoever.",0
"I just found out two days ago that my boyfriend of a year was in a five year relationship and seeing someone else a month ago... i even slept at his place and I never saw anything that indicated someone else lived there. I didn’t even leave until almost 1pm the next day and still didn’t see anyone. Why do men do this? Or go to the extent of saying they see a future with you or doing small romantic gestures if they’re with other people and even SAY they don’t want to see other people. Also, how do you cope with this . i’m a mess, i’m sorry",0
"Even if you confess and are remorseful, having every intention of doing right.

My ex would reach out to me occasionally when her world came crashing down and I always responded and ended our conversations with I love you my best friend.

If your partner expresses she wish she could leave you, but doesn't have the strength to. 

Then tells you if you at least respected her you would break up with her rather than drag this out. 
Because despite all the joy the relationship has brought, this incidents destroyed all the innocence of a monogamous relationship.

Part of me says fight till you drop. 
The other part says I've done enough damage",0
"I’ve come to find out I’m not all that interested in the person I’m currently seeing they’re a great friend but I’m not finding myself enjoying the relationship, I dread when they call me but they’re going through a really difficult time right now and I’m concerned me leaving them would push them over the edge. Should I just hold out till the difficult situation is over or should I just end it now? They are great to me but I just don’t find myself all that into them unfortunately they’re fantastic in every way. I’ve just come to lose attraction and I’ve been thinking of an ex very recently non stop even though there is no hope of them being in contact with me again. I’m scared I’ll lose a friend…",0
in the beginning of the relationship i was scared from past experiences so i kinda pushed him away and then i eventually began to open up and now iam fully in love. he however gave up and seems to have moved on. i want to know what can i do to fix things and work towards getting back together. we are best friends now and we do everything together but im trying so hard i truly love him more than anything. i really need advice on what to do here. thank you so much,0
"So in the past we had issues with my boyfriend being on what’s app and talking to this girl and also his ex. 
So he promised to delete it and not go on it to prevent any issues 

We had an argument during the day about our sex life how it just hasn’t been great lately because we’re both so jammed working 

I go on what’s up this morning to message my sister and I realize he was last online today at 1:20am!! 

He was doing well staying away but now that’s he was on it’s like he didn’t respect our agreement 

No I’m not going through his phone or anything but what bothers me it’s he didn’t keep his word! 

Any advice on how to talk to him",0
"so just a backstory, i met by now bf when i was 16 online, he was 20 at the time

i know he doesnt deserve this but i love him so much and i wasnt even planning on getting into a relationship but here we are

any advice?",0
So I recently broke these off with my girlfriend because we were together for three years and my feelings faded. We tried so hard to make it work but I just felt like i needed to go my own way and do my own thing. But seeing her go out with people I don’t know and feeling just sadness and anger it’s so confusing to me and i know I have no right to be upset but I just don’t know why i feel this way,0

"I have created a video today about how to help someone leave an abusive relationship. Here are some details on creating a safety plan and having a ""Go"" bag and cash ready if you or a loved one needs to get out of a bad situation quickly. 
There is basically a ""fake"" intro at the beginning so it can safely be shared without much chance of someone looking too deeply or to closely at what is being shared. 
Share it with people you love and are afraid for. Make sure you say something like ""I know periods are weird to talk about but I really think you should watch this to the end",0
"The hardest part of healing has been learning to forgive myself for allowing the abuse to continue for so long. I knew it was wrong but I still allowed it. I hoped he would change knowing deep down he wouldn’t. I felt like a complete and utter idiot for believing him. So recently (two weeks ago) it hit me that I’m being to hard on myself. If he managed to fool his lawyer (who believes everything she is told), police and even the crown. It can’t be me that’s the fool, he is just that good at presenting himself in a certain light. Point is, for those who are struggling to forgive yourselves, know that it wasn’t you, they just are Oscar winners and could fool anyone. It was a great epiphany!",0

"So tomorrow is the anniversary day. One year ago tomorrow I thought my life was going to end. I was scared my life was over. My time with my kids was over. I swore that it was the last time I was going to be with my kids. I was told how many different ways he was going to end my life. I was in my car for hours scared to leave my car. Me and my kids traped in my car for hours scared because he knew everywhere I could go. So I had no where. He was lose on the run wanting to kill me. With guns on drugs. I knew if he got ahold of me that was the end of me. 
But here I am today almost a year later. Living a great life. Breathing, living, free!
He gets out of jail in a few weeks and I'm scared but not as scared as I was that day. It made me a fighter it made me strong! I won't ever let him or anyone else make me feel that fear again",0
"Tonight I made stuffed peppers for supper. Now I know y’all are probably thinking, big deal, it’s just stuffed peppers, but stuffed peppers use to be a fire starter for things with my ex. He would absolutely hate when I made them, proceed to tell me that it wasn’t “real supper” and that would start the flow of the energy for the rest of the night, and would of course lead to physical. So I stopped making them, because as many of you know we start to walk on egg shells and do anything and everything we can do avoid making them angry or upset. It felt good tonight making what I wanted , & while I may have times where I struggle, it’s the little things that help remind me I’m exactly on the track I need to be on.",0
"I have a sincere questions. Why many domestic abuser seems to kill themselves after the abused leaves them (of course its not easy to leave, they are emotional and mentally unstable, both loving and hating very soon or alternatively,  so after several attempts one can leave). Keep in mind the abused also goes through violent phases by the abuser where the victim/abused could also have been killed. So we see a pattern of toxic behavior by the abuser. They are not good at emotional attachment or balance or anger management. But do they fall in deep depression after their loved one leaves finally? I am all for leaving for the support of the abused, but how can a society help an abuser get rid of his or her toxic pattern of living so they can also live, like a fully functional adult.",0

"So I had a huge victory tonight. No it wasnt a good situation but I over came a fear and a habit and its one more step of healing. My ex called me said I needed to get the kids because his mom and step dad were fighting and it turned into more of his family fighting all because it was time fore the kids to go home but my ex wasn't ready for them to come home. So I'm on my way he asks if he can stay the night with the kids( I have them fill time , he's trying to move back down from 4 hours away) I said no I don't feel comfortable with you staying. With him being the crazy narcissist he is trying to tell me it will be fine I'll leave tomorrow...well his story kept changing didn't know where he was going the next day or what not I didn't feel comfortable telling him yes he kept going which made it to where we were now fighting and all of this is not ok around kids. Finally I had enough said ok put her in the truck your not going buckled in my kids and I left even though he was mad and before that crying and making my daughter through a fit..I still said no! Girls don't ever give in anymore if you don't want to stick with your guns . No means no and stick to it . They will be mad but they will get over. My kids I hope one day will look back and say mom kept it all together and took care of us and dads over there a fuck up. I got this!",0

Hey everyone thank you for accepting me into this group... On January 27th 2021 I was physically assaulted by my now ex boyfriend he ran up our hallway and kicked me on the chest sending me flying across our living room he then stood over me with a knife and told me to go and get my family he would stab all of them including me as I got up he came towards me again so I lashed out and punched him he grabbed my arms and kept kicking the back of my legs to get me to the ground I started to scream hoping that the neighbours above us would hear me and call the police he ran away leaving me on the floor with the front door wide opened he called me every name in the book I was fat I was a cow a bitch and if I told anyone they wouldn't believe me it wasn't the first time he had hit me he had jammed my arm in doors to the point I thought it was going to break he threw cans of beer at my head he pushed me to the floor now I need to stand up and let people know that things like this are NOT OK I should have left him a long time ago but was scared after nearly 5 months of being away from him I am getting my happy back my friends back my family back and I couldn't be more proud of myself I am so happy I have made a promise to myself that no matter how much I love someone I will never put myself in that position ever again,0
"I was almost killed last year by my ex, 5 staples in my head. There were ATLEAST 3 people in my life who told me I got what I deserve and hopefully next time he will finish the job! I remember feeling soooo angry and hurt! I let it cause a reaction in me that they were able to feed off of. Point of me telling you this is that there will always be people who use your trauma to manipulate or control you by saying things that make you relive those experiences so that they can hold you in the same emotional space you were when you were with him. The reason they do that is because THEY are weak and abusive and want to take over where he left off. DO NOT ALLO THIS! You left hin for a reason, that was a huge step in a positive direction and dont allow ANYONE, even family, to try to take that victory or that healing away from you! The best way to respond, is not to! You DID NOT deserve it, no matter what!! And it is time to heal that beautiful battered heart of yours! Stay strong!!",0
"Two years ago I finally found the strength and courage to leave my abusive/ toxic relationship. It was not easy after two attempts at killing myself and severe anxiety and depression, I finally decided that my life DID mean something, My first step was finding an EMDR therapist. For those of you that do not know what that is, it’s Eye Movement Desensitization and Reprocessing is a psychotherapy technique used to treat anxiety, PTSD, and more.
Instead of letting my abusive partner tear me apart and destroy me, I made different life choices that led me to seek out how I could help others like me. So I went back to school and now I’m a Board certified Life & success coach, clinical hypnotherapist, EFT, NLP & T.I.M.E techniques practitioner
For those of you truly seeking help:
I can help !! 
I can empathize with what you’re going through and don’t mind sharing my entire story with you. What is your freedom, happiness, Self-esteem & life Worth to you?",0
 My girlfriend spat on my face during an argument a week ago and after that day I have been getting weird feelings about how this relationship is going to go ahead. I don't know if this is something common and happens in relationships but I feel like my self respect has been taken away. I fear this will repeat again . Should I break up with her,0
"I’m so sorry to everyone who relates to my posts. No one should ever have to go through this. Just know this is making you a stronger, better person and whoever hurt you is weak. They will stay weak until they, if they ever, change their ways. 

Their punishment will be that they will forever stay who they are. A sad, pathetic child who can’t and will never be truly loved. They will push and hurt everyone that tries to the point that they’ll forever be alone; and that scares them. 

While you? You will grow. You will make it through this and thrive. You will rise above them and prove to them that you are too strong for them to push down. You will show them how amazing and beautiful you truly are.",0
"Today I woke up actually not crying or hating myself! It’s been so long. I still miss my abuser...sort of. But I find I don’t care what he’s doing or how he is doing. He’s just a passing thought that comes up a bit too much. I know how to deal with those better though since I have intrusive thoughts all the time.

My only fear is that once the restraining order is up he’ll try to contact me and knock down all my hard work. I can’t be put into that mental place again...I don’t think I’d survive it.

I know I’m not 100% but the fact that I feel even slightly happy is huge for me. I know there is a lot more to go through and it’s still an uphill battle but I’m here! I’m fucking feeling something other than sadness and numbness. I’m so excited!

It does get better!",0
"I left my abuser who almost killed me about a month ago and I was extremely concerned about where I was going to go given the financial abuse and the fact that he basically destroyed our last apartment. 

HOWEVER, I got approved today for my own apartment in a really nice community. I’m moving in tomorrow after staying with friends and in hotels for the past month. It will actually be my first time living on my own. I’m nervous, but this is actually the first time I’ve felt excitement in years! 

I didn’t think I’d be able to move forward, but it’s actually happening.",0
"He posted bail and has been telling his friends he wants nothing to do with me. I feel heartbroken and so sad. I still love him even though he choked me out. There were so many good memories and then it got all fucked up in a drunken rage.

I want him back but he doesn’t want me. So I’m going to do my best to try and move on. It does get easier every day...sort of. Today I took the step to delete my fb and messenger. He has my phone number so if he really wants to get into contact with me after the restraining order is up he can.

Until then it’s trying to find ways to distract myself and make the days go on until I find I’m not thinking about him at all.",0
"Hey, I just thought it would be amazing if anyone who was the child of domestic violence and broke the cycle would come out and tell their story.
Often we see articles saying that this cycle can’t be broken, that if you see violence in your home growing up you will most definitely repeat that pattern. And yeah, that could be the case, but I believe that there are some survivors out there who went on, healed and now lead a happy life with happy family on their own.
So please, if there’s anyone like this, anyone who’s experienced his dad beating his mom or otherwise on regulal basis in their childhood but decided not to repeat the pattern and found a partner whom he is happy with, PLEASE speak out, it will help many of us to hear some positive stori",0
"Any good book recommendations about living after domestic abuse and becoming your best self. 
Happy to hear about any general self love and mindfulness books as well ",0
"Hi Guys,

I'm a journalist researching an article about domestic violence from the point of view of a male victim. 

This is a subject I feel passionate about and I'd like to raise awareness for a side that doesn't get talked about as much. I'm posting as I'd like to find a few case studies of male victims, so if this is you and you're happy to talk  (anonymously is fine) please get back to me.",0
"After not hearing from my ex for over a year, because he was in prison and then actually following parole, he’s contacting me again.

Texting, calling, leaving voice messages, with veiled threats and accusations. Every couple months I run in to him or randomly see him on the side of the rode I’m driving. I was told it was a) either my imagination or b) coincidence. Well, now I have proof from the escalating phone calls. 

I’m going to report him today. It’s just never easy. You think it’s done and it’s never over. So, I’m working up the courage to contact the police and let them know and then go through the court processes all over again. 

Wanted to share my experience, that while it takes a lot to leave and report and never go back. It also, continues to take a lot each time the abuser comes back.",0
"Hi guys, this is something that I've been wondering about. Something that is really common in abusive relationships is that you never get the closure that you want about it being abuse and the person in the relationship never admits that they deliberately hurt you over and over again, which is even more emotional abuse for the person to deal with. But then I'm confused about this because I've also read about how narcissists 'hoover' their victims, which can often involve them admitting all the bad things they've done and apologising to manipulate their victim into staying with them and thinking they've changed. So which is it? Do narcissists/abusers admit to their abuse or do they not?",0
"My friends keep insisting that my ex will remain stuck, and miserable and never amount to anything, because that is ""what he deserves""

I don't necessarily believe that's true.

Even posion ivy grows... but that doesn't necessarily mean that you want it in your garden.

He is an invasive species, and will continue to thrive at the expense of those around him...  that's how he operates, and no one knows that better than me.

I just won't be letting him squander my resources to survive and thrive any longer.

Its best to focus on the Karma I'm creating for myself, and not sit around waiting for the Karma he's created to come after him.  I've wasted enough time on him.  It's time to start investing in me.",0
"I was so happy, just to know that some one out there wanted my opinion on all of this. He asked me things such as all my experiences of assault, his family and their issues, and all my experiences of his abusive/manipulative manner. It was wonderful to have such a great officer to work with. He was so understanding, and he really seemed to care about every little thing I had to say. It has lifted some of the weight off of me.",0
"After I left my abuser after 3 years I realized something. I wasn’t allowed to have friends, so any time we had a party or anything it was people for him. Everyone came over just for him, never for me. That always made me feel so isolated, until now. I had a room full of people there just because they were friends with me, I didn’t feel excluded for the first time in years. For once I felt like I wasn’t isolated and these friends knew about what happened and I’m so grateful for this. I think this is the best feeling I’ve really had since the end of everything. Restarting my life felt so hard but I’m glad to finally feel happy again.",0
"It’s just not likely to happen though. He wasn’t sorry after yelling at me, making me cry so many times, physically hurting me, breaking my stuff, trashing my car, so why would he be now???

He’s probably just mad at some other girl . Or feeling bad about himself for some other dumb reason.

It also doesn’t matter. The ONLY thing that matters is that I’m whole again. That I’m safe. That I’m surrounded by people who love me. That I love and take care of myself. ",0
"You can’t change how someone treats you but you can change the way you react to it, dig deep to find the inner strength to break free, you deserve better; you don’t always need a plan but you do need courage and to trust in yourself. Break the cycle and speak out.",0
from this or any damage he’s caused me anymore. I’m free.,0
"I am a beautiful, precious woman who deserves safety, comfort, and love.

It’s NEVER OK for anyone to put their hands on me. EVER. It’s NEVER MY FAULT, I didn’t bring this on myself, I didn’t misbehave, and I don’t need to be punished.

For the rest of my life I’m going to set better boundaries, I’m going to parent myself. Obviously never see your abusive ass ever again.

It’s a new life. You would hardly recognize me :)",0
"Today is going to be amazing, another piece laid perfectly in my life puzzle. I’M IN CONTROL OF MY LIFE and it’s an amazing one. ",0
"I deleted all pictures & videos of her. It took forever, but in a few days they will be gone forever.

Sigh.

I’m starting to feel like myself again. I feel human for the first time since 2019.",0
Reminder: you are stronger then you think. You are braver then you think. You are worth so much more. You deserve the best. You can heal from this. You can get out. You are amazing. Inside and out. You are beautiful/handsome. You didn’t deserve what happened to you. Smile that beautiful smile,0
I left my abusive ex boyfriend today for good. He’s someone I never want to encounter again after all our legal shit is over with. This big weight is off my chest.,0
"I no longer feel guilty, and my mind is clear and I think it's time for me to leave this sub, thank you all for being so nice and I hope you all may heal and may you all be well rested.",0
I feel so sorry for my current date i think i should just break up with him. I think i am incapable of love,0
"I told him I didn't feel safe in the relationship anymore and wanted to leave. He tried to make it work for a total of two(2) hours before going back to how he usually is and invalidating me and being rude when he doesn't get his way. He left without saying goodbye and thigh he texted me the next day, I didn't talk to him for a week and a half.

I broke no contact to tell him his things were on the porch if he wants to pick them up.

I'm so proud of myself, and I wanted to share. Thank you guys for all your empowering words and inspiring me to choose myself.",0
"I wanted to suggest a really good book I am reading called ""Why does he do that? In the minds of angry and controlling men"" by Lundy Bancroft. I don't know if it has been suggested here before but it is one of the best books on abusers and how to help yourself that I have read so far",0
"I just realized I haven’t had a panic attack since leaving my abusive ex husband 3 years ago. I had them every few months our entire relationship of 8 years.

Getting yelled at can really mess with you, don’t underestimate it.

Get safe and live a happier life!",0
"I just want to say that once you leave, it really does get better over time. After spending almost every waking moment with my abuser for 3 years, I am re learning how to do the most basic tasks by myself. I've gone to the mechanic alone, carried heavy groceries upstairs alone, made whatever I want to for dinner and watch whatever I want to on TV. I also get to go the gym more often now because I dont have to ""babysit"" him anymore. I'm never in a hurry anymore or wondering when the next moments of abuse will come. 

It gets better. Dont get me wrong, there are good and bad days. But getting to know myself again is becoming less of a scary process and more of a beautiful one. Just thought I would share some encouragement .",0
Feeling so much better today I finally went to my home. The home I bought n owned before him. It's a mess. Hes broke into a third time. My friend is helping me clean it up. I have family helping keep an eye out on it. I had posted about a few things before. My protection order is still in full effect. The judge withdrew my petition to drop it. I bagged up all his belongings and I told his mother she can come and get them when I'm home and I have people with me. As long as it ends him aggravating me so be it. Although she sounded disappointed because she was hoping I would fall right back into his bull. They are lucky I'm willing to let her come and get anything considering how my home looks. But I feel so much better I'm getting it fixed back up. I feel better and stronger everyday. I never thought I'd be at this point.,0
"After being with one physically, mentally, and sexually abusive man, one narc, and one manipulator, I thought I'd just spend the rest of my days alone. I gave up on relationships completely. Then this man came along and completely swept me off my feet. 
He gives me hope, he makes me feel like I'm actually worth something. He makes me smile like no one else ever has. I can honestly see a full future with him .
It gets better ladies, I promise .",0
"Listen up: to all you self sufficient, self supporting, strong willed women that have done it the hard way.... Some people still don't have pots to pee in nor windows to throw it out of and never will. We have to break the cycle. What you need a narcisitic, sorry, abusive and leeching man for? Kick him to the curb. Open your life up for better things. You are better and you deserve better. If you made it this far without his help think how much further you can go without that extra weight. There is help out there to help you break the cycle. Do it for you, and if you have children? They're watching you and the example you set. Set them free and let them feel the peace too.",0
"Our son has autism and adhd. Hes dad has the same thing. Since we left, he has been sleeping in his own bed, which is something I've been struggling with for months. Hes usually a picky eater and now hes trying new things. Hes also has been acting violent lately. Since we left, his behavior has improved. I had no idea the environment could effect a kid so much. Has he really improved this much just because we moved??",0
I've been through hell and I'm. Finnaly talking about it. Two years have passed and now I can say that I feel better. It was such a struggle to leave this relationship and so hard to understand it was not love. Thank you for excepting me,0
"Maybe some of you remember me from a few weeks ago. But I’ve left! I’m FREE! I was sitting here after finally coping,cleaning and taking apart my first ever tv that he smashed. As I took out all 4 screws it just made me notice how much I put up with and how much better I deserve. I deserved my tv unlike he thought. I’m a boss bitch! Imma slay this single momma game. I just felt like I needed to share some
Of my recovery...to maybe show someone else is so worth it/ so possible!",0
"Just so everyone knows and to those who do know already,  it never gets better.  I don't care what the situation is,  if there's abuse, it won't get better. Turn away and find your self.  They will never change. Get away before you lose yourself and get away before they take you.  Please.  There's people on here that have done that and I look up to them. I'm in the process... still,  bc I went back and learned my lesson 5 times or so now.  They do not change.  Not at all.  Maybe they will for a bit or two,  but not forever and it'll get worse!!!! Police can't always step in. Yall,  please,  walk away, no matter how hard it is or it gets.  Get away!!!!!!  
I haven't posted in forever,  but it was on my heart to tell someone,  to step away,  get away,  whatever you have to do,  we all wish it could get better or be better,  but it just isn't worth it and it will not ever work out... please listen to me or other women that are above me on here that have been out of this crazy maze!!!",0
Ladies my new man is amazing he worked 10 hours today and still stopped and got me flowers in his way home.  trust me ladies we deserve better then what we went thru. We all can find happiness,0
"I never thought this would happen to me. Everything started off like a fairytale. Things gradually started to get worse. The arguments, the name calling, yelling, shoving- then Friday night he exploded and this was the result. I stayed so long because I thought he loved me, and when things were good between us they were magical. I allowed myself to think that things would get better, that he really did love me. This is NOT what love looks like or feels like. NO ONE deserves to end up in a hospital and looking like this. I feel like sharing this and my story somehow takes the power away from him. I am a survivor.",0
"One year free!!!  For 4.5 years I endured things. Last seven months were the worst . Two weeks I was held against my will, I had to wait till he was at work  and stayed at work , too grab what I could and leave. I will never go back!
. I look back at times and beat my own self up for what I put up with and then I remember I am strong. We were all strong!! One day at a time! We got this!",0
... Following the lead of so many beautiful survivors on here ... And I didn’t think I’d ever publically share this but I’m so proud of being Narc free! 6 months and counting!No more swollen face or painful tears for me .,0
"I left my abuser in August. the kids and I finally have a place and aren't staying with family anymore. last night as I'm doing our first grocery pick up since we moved in, im adding stuff to my cart and I realized just how free I am now, no more worrying about making someone mad bc I bought food they don't like. We can eat vegetables again he hated veggies I made them as a side he'd get mad and throw them he would only eat fries and meat if it was on pizza I made the kids he'd throw it in the trash. We can all eat anything we want now without the worry I even had a little satisfaction deleting his precious mt dew from my favorites that I so many times had to get instead of something I or the kids needed. It's very freeing these small victories no one really thinks about I think we all need to share more of these things. I'm hoping this gives someone else some hope it does get better once your out away from the abuse.",0
"The first pic is a pic of me when I first left my abuser. You can see the pain, depression, the low self-esteem in my face and the look in my eyes.

The second pic is me today feeling happy, wonderful, beautiful and free to be me. I have had a total transformation. Believe me when I say it wasn't easy. And I have only been free since Nov. 1st, and in spite of being homeless I am extremely happy, satisfied and secure in my own skin. it is such a powerful feeling when you realize you are worth it, you arent ugly, you a horrible person. I am here to tell every one its all worth it, I have been drug to the bottom a few times since I left, but I wouldnt trade any of it for the peace, happiness, and carefree life that i have now. And I am 53 yrs old starting a new life anyone can do this!!!",0
"One month free from my son and my abuser...everyday comes with really hard thoughts and struggles yet so much happiness and freedom...freedom to be myself, cook what I want, play and sing with my son wherever in the house and not locked in his room. I found out I was pregnant right after and it shook my world..still fighting with court getting my DVPO and custody settled but everything should be settled by next Wednesday..I’m nervous even thinking about it but it’s going to be fine...I have learned..what will come will come and we will meet it when it does...",0
"Good afternoon, all! My name is Camille and I am an 8 year survivor of domestic violence. I am also a doctoral student at Trevecca Nazarene University in Nashville, Tennessee. I am writing a dissertation on the Unfulfilled Needs of Domestic Violence Survivors and am seeking to interview survivors who have been free of abuse for at least 6 months to better understand their experiences. Interviews would be conducted via Facebook Messenger or Skype, and would take about an hour of your time, following the recruiting, screening, and consent process. The hope is that by recording the lived experiences of survivors, service providers can be better informed about how to help abuse victims. Your information will be kept completely private. If anyone is interested, please either comment below or send me a private message. Thank you in advance!",0
"Almost 11 years, I've been free and in the past 6 months i have blocked 9 new accounts for him, because he keeps sending me msgs similar to these. 
I felt safe finally, I thought that part of my life was gone and in the past. Obviously I was wrong! I've started flinching at my own children if they move to fast next to me, I have not slept without nightmares. I went Friday and took out a protective order. He may he in a different state but only a half hour drive. 
His mind set is definitely off and he has threatened to send his spirits after me... I have no idea what I'm in store for!!! 
I was happy, I was safe, I felt secure in life and confident in my self.
It's all gone now, I feel like a scared little girl again!",0
I am a adult child of DV. I was abused in every way you could abuse a daughter. Scared to death as a child. The breaking point or my proof was my sister being there when he was trying to physically force my to the bedroom. She and I fought so hard that night. I guess he realized there was someone else there and I now had proof so could expose him. He just let go and left the house. I ran away that night to my mothers. That was  situation of alcoholism and domestic abuse but not directed at me. After 3 years of all I could stand I ran away and married the first of 3 times and dealt with DV.  I have been free for 3 years now and have peace and happiness I. My life.,0
It's been only a few Months...the scars are still there the pain is still there but I will glow forever as I will continue my journey alone ...17 years of abuse I am finally free...I am a SURVIVOR,0
"I had to share somewhere since I’m sooo excited!! I got a tattoo when I was in my abusive marriage of my spouses voice waves saying forever and always. Well 9 months after ending it I made the appointment to get my cover up !! 

My tattoo artist and I worked out a design to put black dahlias over it (since they symbolize betrayal but are very strong and resilient flowers) and i am SOOO EXCITED to not have to look at this everyday! Anyone else have a tattoo to symbolize breaking free??",0
10 months ago I was so broken. I never thought the pain and trauma I was going through was ever going to end. Today I am glowing. I am free and beginning to love myself again. Most importantly I survived. I chose my kids. I chose myself. On my darkest days when I felt like I had no one I could connect to everyone in this group. The support given here is a gift unmatched.,0
"I want to inspire someone today!
What most people don’t know, I am a survivor!  Many said, you don’t fit the profile. You are strong. You are always happy and you have always smiled. 
Well - there is no profile for domestic violence!  Someone everyday is suffering from some type of domestic violence. 
No one knew!  I hide it from the world!  One decision, I found myself living that lifetime movie that I always would say - “She is crazy.  That wouldn’t be me.”
Guess what - it ended up being my story.  
I left!  I had a daughter.  I would never let her think it was normal for a man to treat a woman that way.  I am still here!  I hit rock bottom and lost everything except the clothes on my back.  
I was strong but I am stronger now!  My past is not a struggle that defines me. It wasn’t a struggle that others should hear and judge.  It was a part of my journey that made me who I am today.  A strong woman, mother, and determined individual to help others in many ways. 
I am authentic.  I have the strength of a lion for anything out to destroy me. Nothing can hold me down and God has been and will continue to be with me on this journey called “Life.”

"To the ladies that are still in an abusive relationship: You are in my thoughts and prayers, I know it’s hard to leave. When you’re ready always remember help is there!

You are on your way. And abuse is NEVER ok. You made the right decision.
To the ladies that have been out for awhile and still have trust issues: work on that. Don’t let it hold you back. Keep working on yourself. You can trust again and you should trust again. It takes time. 
To the advocates, therapist, counselors, professionals etc. that work with DV victims/survivors: Thank you for what you do! You make the world a better place.
And to the survivors that are thriving! You did that! You put the work in and nothing can stop you now! Keep going.
