"My boyfriend hit me again this am due to my smart mouth. Why can’t I just keep my mouth shut? I keep antagonizing him. It’s all my fault really.  
He’s hit 8 times and spit on 5. He verbally & emotionally abuses me but he says I do all that to him & he’s just responding to what I say. 
He’s been pushing me away. My friends are over an hour to see. His friends are 10 min away and he tells me to get a life. He wants more time with friends and he says I’m up his ass all the time. I don’t make friends easily and tend to be alone with my major depressive disorder. That makes it worse. He wants to hang out with his mom & best friend. Really?! 
My heart is in so much pain I cry all the time or become livid. If I kept my mouth shut this wouldn’t happen. 
Oddly enough I love him. I’ve NEVER dealt with anyones shit in a relationship. Why now Is beyond me. Plus when we fight he won’t have sex with me. We rarely do and it’s almost 2 years together. 
This makes me feel so ugly, fat, worthless, alone, livid, unloved and feel that people really don’t care. 
We have 2 puppies and I can’t leave or I will lose them forever. I would rather make sure my pups are ok & deal with this. Besides my pain is too much to deal with anymore.",1
"I am having the worst panic attack. Long story short. After 2 and a half years of being away from my abuser, and 2 years of therapy to get over what he did to me and zero contact from him he is back in the picture. We have a 4 year old son. He has not seen him in 2 and a half years since I left. He didn't even try to see him at all. Fast forward 2 and a half years he wants custody. He was granted supervised visitations. They start next week. I am the one that has to supervise! He has no family here for anyone to supervise so the court left it to me. I CAN NOT be around that man. The court in my county does not offer any type of court appointed people to supervise. I'm shaking and feel sick. He almost killed me many times. He went to jail for a year for strangling me and cutting me on my neck with a knife. I needed 20 stitches. My lawyer thinks this is bullshit so I trying to figure out a different plan. The court system makes 100 percent no sense.",1
"Hi Ladies , I have recieved a letter from my abusive ex’s attorney who is already on IVO requesting parenting arrangments prefered to have his kid over for few hours on weekends. In previous arrangments with myself he wasn’t safe and used his manipulation tactics. So he’s reaching out to me with attorney’s now. 
Has anyone been in similar situation?
Any advice would be appreciated",1
"Hi. I am really struggling. First time I’ve posted in this group but looking for support. Just about two weeks ago I pressed charges against my husband for sexual assault. There’s a no contact order in place. And all our mutual friends have shut me out.I am having a really hard time with dealing. I love the guy. Yes, he hurt me. Yes, he’s abusive. Yes, I’m safe now. And I understand that. But I love him deeply. We have a son together. We built a family. And now to not be able to see him, talk to him, explain anything. It’s breaking me in half. The physical pain and agony I am in overwhelms any of the thoughts I have or could have. I am unable to eat. Unable to sleep. Struggling to take care of my son on my own. As well as our dog. I hate this. Everybody says that it will be hard. But everything seems impossible! Nobody said anything about the physical agony of all of this. How everybody would leave or just not talk to you because there is the law involved now.",1
 I’m literally shaking right now. He wants to talk. He wants to discuss the abuse without arguing even though he’s said it’s not abuse or DV. Do I let him say his peace and risk being hurt but also get more validation that I’m making the right choice? I just don’t know that I’m strong enough to not start defending myself or justifying my reaction.,1
"I’m meeting with an attorney for the first time this morning. I’m scared that I won’t have the courage to do what I know needs to be done. I think the biggest piece is filing for a divorce and a restraining order. I feel like I’m going to hurt him because he doesn’t believe it’s abuse or domestic violence and because I love him so much when he’s not raging. I’m trying to remember that it’s the abusive part of him I’m protecting myself from and that once I file for divorce it’s likely he’ll turn from a loving spouse into the vindictive, angry person he’s shown several times in the past.The trauma bond is real and I just hope I can face my self doubts and choose to put myself first.Any words of encouragement for me this mornig",1
"Hi Everyone, I am new member here. This is not about me or my marriage, but this is about my Friend who lives in South Carolina and who is suffering from an emotional abuse by her husband for years now. Is there anyone who knows an agency that I can contact or a support group in that area to contact and report this abuse? My friend doesn't have access to a phone or internet all the time. She only contacts me when she can because her husband is very controlling. Besides, her husband did not paid their phone bills last month and their phone was disconnected. I don't know what to do as well. I want to help her, but I am too far away from her. All I can do is to report it to the right agency of domestic/emotional abused. Please I need some advice and if anyone is from Jacksonville, SC here. Thank you.",1
"Need some advice I just got married last month in Florida my husband lives in FL I live in North Dakota. I'm starting to think he married me for the wrong reasons. He never directly ask me for money he'll just keep telling me all the Bill's he has to pay I have helped him with Bill's in the past. He wants me to buy him a Dodge charger for his birthday in September . Since we got married he has hit me, disrespected me, called me bad names. It's like soon as we got married he changed please dont ask why because I dont know. He use to be so so sweet. Do you think he will change or should I just walk away.BTW I have my own everything house 2 cars and a good job he has given me nothing.",1
"Hi. 
I’m here because two days ago I was hit in the face  by my boyfriend in front of my kids while I was driving. Luckily I was able to stop the car and after struggling with him because he took my phone to stop me from calling the cops was able to get out of the car and stop other cars to get help. He ran after more people pulled over to see what happened.
Yesterday he was caught and was arrested and was found with heroin and drug paraphernalia on him. I’m so torn and my emotions are all over the place. I will be seeking out a therapist for me and my 5 year old daughter who was very close to my boyfriend. My eye is black and blue with a gash right below my eyebrow and a gash on my nose. My physical pain will heal but it will take some time for my emotional and mental pain to heal. It’s going to be a long process and hopefully I can get through this.
Thanks for listening.",1
Hello thank you for the add I joined the group not necessarily for me but my sister she is currently in a love-less mentality abusesive relationship as well as her son her partner doesn't care or love not only her but their son she recently came and visited Washington for 4 months and he told her to just stay gone but she wanted her son to finish his school year in California now he is telling her that she will never be able to leave with her son and she just wants out for both her and her sons best interest I know a lot of times you can't but was wondering if I could share a go fund a friend of hers made for her so she can divorce him and fight for custody and get out of this abusesive relationship,1
I had zoom meeting for court with my x abuser....seeing him hearing his voice.....made my survive mode kick in...can't sleep...my heart is racing...I haven't slept sound....nitemares every nite....he's states apart yet....just his voice sent me rite back to where it all began....so many memories...so much pain....I feel like I'm dying every nite wake gasping for air....God help me please...,1
"My physical pain is healing but I know I still have a long way to go emotionally and mentally. Every woman always thinks when they watch movies, tv shows, hear about other women being abused that “that will never be me.” I was with my boyfriend for less than a year but didn’t realize all the emotional and mental abuse he was doing until he got physical with me 3 days ago. He would always say the right things, act the right way and pull me back in. Not this time though. While he sits in jail I am here trying to heal the pain he caused me and my kids. Trying to get past all this pain while my heart is breaking because I did love him and I did want us to work out and him be a father to my kids. That all changed when he put his hands on me and sent me to the hospital. I go back to work tomorrow still with a black and blue eye and with healing scars. Trying to get my life back the way it was before him. I know it’ll get better but I wish I never had to experience this kind of pain",1
"After months of physical and emotional pain I am almost completely healed from my last surgery and my abuser was just finally sentenced to 10 years state prison. Honeslty I'm not sure how to even feel. After so many charges being dropped and negotiation going on forever, I'm left disappointed. Even though I know I should be grateful for any amount of time considering how many people don't get any justice at all. My plan was to go to see him being sentenced so I could say what I needed to say, hear him admit guilt and feel some sort of closure. I couldn't even face him because I feel jipped. Like he won again. We listened to it livestream and my mom cried, my sister cried and I just felt blah. Like with all the time taken off with good behavior he will be out in a few years and he'll just come after us again. How do I stop feeling so negative towards this? I want to celebrate that I'm finally free of him but I just don't feel anything. I do plan on bringing this up to my therapist later on today but I'd like to hear some thoughts. Has anyone else dealt with these types of emotions or lack there of?",1
I’m meeting with an attorney tomorrow to start the divorce process. He knows where I’m at (staying with friends in another state) and I’m afraid he’ll come after me. My fiends are moving at the end of the month so I was thinking of waiting until then. The only problem with that is I think he’s beginning to suspect I’m not coming back and might take action (either legal or destroying things)…he’s very calculating and so is his entire family so I could see them making moves quickly. Any advice on what the right path forward is?,1
New to the group this morning and I’m struggling with feelings of guilt and like I’m betraying my abusive spouse by leaving. I just can’t go back but I don’t know how to express that to him or if I even should. I’m recently separated and just going through a rollercoaster of emotions. Any words of wisdom?,1
The courts didn't even care about all the evidence. We (my small daughters and i) were denied protection and he has now began filing unlawful detainer. I am 34 weeks pregnant. How can he be getting away with this? What can I do?? We were unmarried but don't I have equitable rights or something? He cut off utilities as retaliation and even was in contempt of the stay away order. The system is sooo broken and I am so angry. This is the exact reason he is how he is. Because he knows he can get away with it!,1
I am a mom of 4 girls and I’m 35 years old. My current husband is the dad to 2 youngest girls. We have been together almost 13 years married almost 11. He used to be physically abusive to my kids and now not so much but very mentally and emotionally abusive. I’ve tried leaving and came back but now my girls and I are finally trying to get brave and leave. We are tired of being scared of him. And scared of wondering if he will get physical again. Any tips to stay brave??,1
I can really use some support tonight. I already left the abuser and he’s out but I had a baby- baby is his and he wants custody so I know the court will grant him at least some parenting time which means I will never truly be free from him. I’m hurt because my baby is so beautiful and people think what I went through is insignificant when he wants me dead. He strangled me so many times and told me how he was going to dispose of my dead body. I’m terrified and feel so alone and like no one understands what it’s like to have lived through domestic violence and to have a baby with one. There is no escaping.,1
I almost had him out and I ended up letting him talk about stuff. I had door locks changed. He was out on the streets afraid to come back because of the cops. I don't know why I let this happen. I feel fucking stupid. Like I forgot all the harm he has caused because he said he was done with the stuff he was doing. He did quit drinking over a year ago after jail. And that was a trigger. I have been jaded and felt trapped. I had him out and I was alone in my house. I am so embarrassed that I made moves to get him out and I let him right back in. What's wrong with me?,1
"I need words of encouragement more than ever…I’m not doing very well. As if breaking my nose 3 weeks ago wasn’t enough to leave him, I caught him still talking to the girl he was cheating on me with too. I cut him off and blocked him….I haven’t heard from him except once to let me know he would be with her. It’s been 3 days and I’m losing it. Losing myself and FAST",1
I think the hardest thing. is to actually leave. im currently in a relationship that's abusive.. he also broke my nose.. and im still hear.. I always tell myself the next time I will leave. Here I am with a 3 week old baby. Still debating if I should leave.. why does it feel as if im betraying him every time I think to leave.. its so much harder than people even know.,1
He did this bc I don't wanna have sex. I was sleeping. He made promises he was done drinking. He did good for a month and a half . The day I withdrew the order of protection He started drinking. He threatened me with videos hetook of me bawling after he's taken my child so I figured I would record what happens before I get to this point. I'm mentally done . I'm tired they didn't give me anything to protect me when I called my local safe harbors. I was unable to pay for food and necessity for my daughter because I wasn't home working. I just want my daughter safe but I don't want her taken from me .,1
I got in a domestic violence case back in February. Recently my abuser has been telling everyone a completely different story to make it out to seem like I’m the bad person. He is much more well known then me so he is trying to get everyone against me. And idk how to cope with it. Any advice for speaking my truth and how to properly tell my story? Or any advice in general?,1
So the other day he pushed me on the ground grabbed me by my neck and was calling me hoes and the B word. What do you do if someone has 3 pending charges against you ? But the court dates keep getting pushed back due to covid. Do you leave ? Or stay until you get him to drop the charges ? If I leave he won't drop the charges. I have a Med Tech License and soon getting my CNA and Med Aide. I can't use them if im found guilty. All the 3 charges are against him. I can't take this anymore. I'm literally burning up on the inside. The abuse i can't bear any more but I love Healthcare I'm very goal oriented.,1
"Just want to say I am completely sick and tired of the waking nightmares/thoughts/scenarios involving past abusers, my sister, who I haven't spoken to in 15yrs and all the heartache from it all. 
I drink so I can sleep and stop the thoughts but kids make me feel guilty so I don't drink then I get hammered with thoughts.
Just can't win",1
"Is anyone else just numb, like, they cant feel much or respond to much anymore? I cant rely on anger to make me leave because I dont really feel anything. If anger bubbles up it quickly disappears.The more beaten I am the more frozen I am. Got strangled again today, my body is covered in bruises all the time now, I can't walk properly. You'd think I'd be compelled to leave, wouldn't you?",1
I cant bring myself to care. My familiar comfort zone feels less scary than going out into the world to a shelter. I'm so fragile and anxious and honestly more afraid of the unknown than of staying here even if it kills me. Other people terrify me. I only feel comfortable around him. Convince me to leave please because I cant convince myself. Thank you.,1
"I don’t want to be chronic homeless. My kids Dad has completely abandoned us to just live his life with his crazy ass mom. I recently filed for custody although now I’m thinking of enlisting in the military. 
I want the benefits for my children. I want reinvention for myself. I don’t want to be a DV victim that waited for handouts and charity. I want to be a DV survivor that never fell victim again. 
Idk how to enlist and care for my children. I don’t have a lot of support in the way of childcare. An my children are toddlers.",1
I try not to post things about my husband my abuser but a person can only stay strong for so long. I've been dealing with it for 5 years I'm stronger than this I don't even know why I've put up with it for so long. Battered women's syndrome is real and it sucks. Mentally and physically I'm at my lowest. How do you overcome and become yourself again?,1
"I’m shaken with this fear I’ve tired praying away. 
I just want to be in peace. I want these flashbacks and nightmares to go away forever.
All I think about is me dead and my kids in danger. I’m fucking terrified… like he’s gonna come back and try again.
I’m tired of holding in these damn thoughts… I feel alone in a way… like no one understands.",1
"I am with this man for 12 years and he drinks everyday till the bottle of Jack is empty. He even mixed it with other alcohol. We have two kids. A girl (11) and a boy ( 10). 
He gets too wasted and become mean and unruly to me. One time he even locked me out and acted like nothing happenedthe next day. 
This time, he wants me stay at my friends and don’t want me home anymore. My friend’s son is my son bff too. I thought before school starts to go do something. 
I don’t know what to do. I am tired of all these.",1
"
I hate that I have thoughts about making things work with my abuser. It’s not okay. Things are beyond toxic it’s deadly. Yet the thoughts float into my head of how to make it work. 
I need therapy or something to refocus and redirect my thoughts and intentions. Any advice welcomed!",1
"This is my first post, he choked me, grabbed my chin, got arrested for domestic violence, had no contact order, being held on a bond… but by do I still feel embarrassed guilty lonely miss him",1
"I need some help... I am not going to lie, I am very nervous to even post due to my soon to be ex husband seems to find everything. Currently I am still living in the same home as him due to our 3 children and I know by experience what he will try and use against me... they always try and blame their actions and their thoughts on you. I need a portable voice recorder instead of using my phone. Its too difficult to start recording when he is around and chaos is happening. Plus the red light is always on when I am recording on my phone. Any ideas on what could be safe?",1
"Why is it that I spend every waking day hating my life because he has put me through so much in 18 years. I’m scared he will kill me one day and so I pray I can escape I pray he will leave. So today I explain to him one more time that I can’t handle doing this again, and he’s ok with separating. And inside I start feeling so lonely and scared. But I know separating is the best thing to do.. why do I feel so sad about it. He sounds like he may really leave or let me go however past experiences have shown me otherwise. I’m so afraid for what I future holds with or without him..",1
"I’ve completely left my abuser . No contact. And emergency protective order in place. He still has custody of our son we go back in September . How can I be able to show evidence of the trauma and abuse our son has witnessed in the house that I used to live with the abuse? There is a gaping hole in the wall beside my sons bedroom door, his dad put 2 huge white poster boards over the hole and hasn’t fixed it since it has happened. How would I be able to get law enforcement or the guardian adlitem to take a look at the wall?",1
"Got drunk and called my abuser. He said everything I wanted to hear. I'm still miserable though. Nothing he said changed anything. 
I'm still a single mom of two. I still struggle to work full time and be  mom and dad. I still feel like I'll never love or trust again. I still see dating as impossible. I still don't know how to make friends. I still see myself in all the ugly ways he made me look at myself. I still feel hopeless.",1
After dealing with his mess for over 2 years today was a wake up call for me. He got overly drunk got mad at everything I did or said punched the wall and then started to punch me in my head my face my stomach. If that wasn't good enough he grabbed a gun we had locked up and pulled it on me and said I better start listening to him or walk out of his house. So when he pulled the gun I called the cops and now he is in jail and I packed my stuff and walked away. I don't even know how to process anything that happened today.,1
I am out of my abuse situation and have been for 5 years. My daughter however has gotten into one and has custody of my two grandchildren who are under the age of ten. She keeps telling me that she is close to leaving her abuser and it doesn’t happen in front of the kids. I am so afraid for my grandkids. I want to go to counseling for myself but am afraid if I do they could take her children away if they feel they are in any danger. This is really eating away at me.,1
Hello I feel like an ass to even post again about this.nHe hurt me again today it's been months since he hit me this time inwas driving down the hwy. He screamed at me you smell back down there thats why I stop having sex with you so much your face is coved in black heads it's ugly. I like high society women you need to fix yourself. Cussed more all while punching me while I was trying to drive. I was and take care of myself every day I have a condition that messes up my hormones and other stuff. I do so much for him but when he drinks he is the ugliest asshole I ever seen. Idk what's wrong with me I try so hard every day to help him. My step dad passed away this week I wanted to get out the house and get my mind off it.,1
So I’m 20 weeks pregnant by my emotional abuser. What notes can I begin keeping that might help me when the baby is born for future custody issues? I’ve dealt with physical abuse before (different relationship) as well as emotional but not just emotional. I’m worried about the safety of my unborn child.,1
I am so scared. Left my abuser a week ago and he was pounding on my doors at 1:30 this morning. My son forgot to lock the back door and he walked in very drunk!! Luckily I was in the back of my house and was able to push him outside and lock the door. He eventually left but I'm terrified of him,1
"What do you do to help with depression? I'm really struggling today. I take meds but they don't seem to be working lately. My whole world has been turned upside down. I've lost everything, I'm hiding/ living in an apt with 3 windows and all I can see is privacy fence. There's nowhere to go sit outside and it's been raining most of the afternoon. I'm lonely and my family has all turned their backs on me because I refuse to let him get off with a slap on the wrist for putting a loaded gun to my head and beating me. Yesterday would have been our 26th wedding anniversary. My daughter is worried that he might commit suicide i wish she cared about the way I'm feeling right now.",1
"Hi everyone,
I believe someone in my life may be in serious danger. I need help. I know this may not be the right group but I’m desperate. What are the signs of a man who is capable of murdering his partner? Are there steps they follow? Please help. I need stories, advice, resources, web links, whatever I can get. I’m scared for her. She’s with a guy who has a history of physical violence (he knows martial arts) towards friends, family members (mostly his autistic brother), my friend (his partner), animals (he actually used to shoot and kill them with BB guns as a child and I know he’s abusive to their current animals and will throw and hit them), I think he’s even shown aggression and violence(?) to the baby they have together. He’s also sexually abused her for years and is addicted to pornography. I don’t know all of the details but she’s been telling me for years she feels like he might kill her some day. I just need help. I don’t know what to do. The police have never done anything to help in the past, and I’m scared that if she gets the courage to leave, it will end really badly. How do I help her leave him? Part of me is scared I’m just putting these thoughts in my head but I know some signs are there and I’m so scared for her",1
"Hello all, I'm new here and have recently left a long term physically and emotionally abusive relationship. I feel lost and confused as a part of me still loves and misses him but I'm fully aware that his actions and behavior were extremely narcissistic and abusive. How do I move past? How do I stop thinking about him? ",1
"Hi Members,  I'm a 20 year old Tunisian woman who has been physically, emotionally and coercively abused by her parents. Diagnosed with PTSD and having a chronic disease, I m seeking organizations who can offer me a safe shelter outside my country since it's not safe for me here. Do you know any organizations that can help me ?",1
"Me and my child's father had a little disagreement and I don't know if he slapped me or punched me it all happened so fast but my jaw is out of place, I can't really close my mouth I'm not in much pain but it does bother me I can feel that something is wrong with it when I bite down. My head also feels weird. 10 minutes later things got worse I ended up grabbing a knife and he grabbed his gun. He told me he would blow my brains out. My 5 month old is in the other room crying from being in pain with constipation I was scared. I need some strength, I need some help.. I need to know that I will be alright without this man. I have to go",1
"My ex boyfriend wants me back in his life, I'm scared and I keep saying no. He keeps pressuring me to go back to him. During the 1 year of having a relationship with him. He was controlling,  abusive physically, sexually and mentally. I'm having bad anxiety and nightmares.",1
My husband works and I'm a stay at home mum who is also currently pregnant. My husband is a domestic abuser. Can he legally stop my access to our money if only his name is on the account? He is now asking for his consent to purchase anything.,1
"When does the abuse actually stop when the protective orders essentially only stops someone from threatening to kill you or physical violence? My abuser harasses and provoked me through parenting app, him and his parents stalk me through forcing FaceTime with the kids to track our location every day of the week. I can’t work because my kids are bound to visitation and I am being harassed and provoked daily and my kids are deeply suffering, yet all I can afford is the numerous lawsuits my abuser and his parents file against me. I am SO tired, I am alone in the US with my whole family abroad and my beautiful kids are being told that liars will burn in hell every day (their dad tells everyone I am a liar). I really thought the abuse would end once I spoke out, it’s just changing forms and his parents are helping him abuse me.",1
I went through almost 8 yrs of abuse and been parted for 3 yrs he put court papers on me and we start court in 2 months. His affidavit is full of lies and says I abused him and the kids. I can't evan deal how do I stand in court without breaking down from the ptsd? How can he say I was the one who abused my kids? How do I prove his lies? He doesn't care about the kids it's all for his sense of winning. I have to pay its gunna put me in a hole. I have to take time off work. This is all too much for me.,1
I want to leave but my husband is so controlling and domenering that he says he would fight for the kids and the kids said they want to stay with him. So I’m trapped,1
"He choked me on April 1st. He constantly talks down to me. He threatens or beats me when I confront him about lies he constantly tells me. I found a hotel key in the car on Thursday he swears a friend left it in his car. He complains because I won't have sex with him because I have osteoarthritis in my right knee. He officially left Sunday, yet left a ton of stuff he says I can just throw it away. I dont understand why my heart is broken, I wanted him to leave, but I miss him and I'm 43 I'll be alone for the rest of my life. I can't stop crying what is wrong with me. Why do I love the man that almost killed me?",1

Today my husband told me he wish I would jump off a bridge and I work long hours and come home around 2 am in the morning and expects me to wake up and do everything and when I explain that I need rest then he gets mad. We have 4 kids together and we've been married for 12 years and now I always feel sick and have chest pain and I just want to give up and just jump. Plus I hate him and love him so much and yet I continue to stay despite everything and talking about my body so I don't eat a lot anymore and i wish i would die.,1
Bro Does anybody have this problem when they’ve been abused I got out of a domestic violence relationship everyone just believes the abuser I don’t have no friends I literally have no one I have no life because of him ,1
Struggling so much and I really need support/advice on how to get through feeling so guilty. I feel so guilty for calling the cops on my now ex boyfriend but I know it needed to happen bc the physical abuse wasn’t stopping. I know I deserve better but the emotional attachment is still there and I’m hurting so much.,1
"ן was physically&mentally abused by my children's father for 5 years... the first time he physically abused me was in 2017 when my son was 4 months old, he choked me in my closet and from then it just got worse he ALWAYS did it in front of my kids, he had no care for what they saw.The last straw for me was last month when he strangled me so hard that i blacked out and urinated on myself. ן was out for about 5 minutes and yes he did this to me infront of my kids... it is so sad for me to say that my children dont even cry or scream anymore because well i believe they was use to seeing us fight. He would pull my hair&drag me across the floor, he would slap me, he punched me in my mouth one time, he would bang my head up against the wall, but he would mostly ALWAYS Choke&Slap me and im just so ASHAMED of myself for staying for 5 years. Im heartbroken on so many levels that i feel i cant get into another relationship because i am so scared",1
"I am all over place I was abused for years almost died being chocked to death alot of bad things in the hands of my kids father.He did change at end he passed two yrs ago suddenly.I am ashamed I put up with it alot people ask me how I grieve for him when hurt me?my kids love and miss him.I am suffering in silence don't wanna talk bad in front my kids.I was mentally, verbally, physically abused.Its me with no self Worth left.He put me down and I believed him couple suscide attempts and they think I'm just nutz Because I never told because of him.He would show up and tell Dr I am nutz can he 302 me.He held all that against me.Why??I am all over I hate him,I love him,miss him but feel ashamed I stayed.",1
I know it's time to leave and I am finding the strength daily to leave my husband. One day he asked me if he has ever lied to me and I told him yes you did every time you say you will not hit me again and yet you did. Then he proceeds to tell me that he was drunk and he doesn't want to hit me or he doesn't remember hitting me. All I can think of is that he doesn't get it. A lie is a still a lie and a punch or choke is still just that. Any advice besides leave because I am already working and planning to leave carefully,1
"I’m scared, like really scared. Last night he flipped out on me after I went to sleep. He has never in 11 years ever woke me up to yell at me. He called me a slut a cunt a whore told me I was heartless that I’m using him for his money (every time I’ve tried to work he has threatened to leave while watching HIS kids). Then he told me if I wasn’t gonna give him sex he was going to cheat on me. Then he started Slamming doors and throwing shit and hitting furniture, his dresser is busted beyond repair 
He’s never gotten this out of control before, I think he knows somethings up or off and I’m so worried he’s gonna do something irreversible. 
It’s Sunday so I still have 20 hrs till the courthouse opens up",1
"Divorced my ex almost 2 years ago , went thru domestic violence court last year been fighting for custody for the last year and half and finally received full custody. We are still going thru a second domestic violence with him against our 12 year old daughter. We finally moved out of state and have been living our lives and now I have terrible dreams every night 😞 I wake up crying and panicked.  When does this all stop ?",1
"I’m struggling! I left my abusive relationship alive by the grace of god in October of 2019. I still struggle. I have good moments, and have made huge strides since then, but the PTSD is real and it’s difficult to deal with",1
Planning on up and moving away starting my own life with my child I’m scared assf never been on my own and having a hard time landing a job so I think imma try to get in a program/shelter  . trying to find the strength and the faith that I can do this and not loook back,1
"Really struggling and I need help. 
Today- he found his way to jail. He pushed me down, threw so much shit at me, bust my head open & I still feel horrible. My kids are begging for their daddy. I tried to get everything to end,   He came outside just as the cops were leaving, or he would have avoided being arrested. 
Why do I feel bad? Why do I want to wait for him no matter what? Why do I feel I can’t live without him, well financially I can’t. But I know this isn’t love. 
As I sit here, bawling my eyes out, while my girls cry for their daddy… I wonder how I’ll make my way out of this. How I’ll heal after 10 years, blaming myself because I instigate by running my mouth. 
I’ve never felt so low & alone in my entire life.

I finally filled out an application for an apartment. I’m secretly hoping he chooses the other person who applied.  I’m having so many reservations about leaving. I keep thinking that if he physically abused me it would be easier to leave. I feel horrible for even thinking that. He doesn’t. That’s what makes me question whether or not it’s just me and I’m just being overly sensitive. He has two sides. A very loving incredible side and the side who is a narcissist. Please please help me find the strength to do what I have to do.,1
"Where do I begin? I'll start with saying I must be crazy. I was in an abusive marriage for 7 years...it ultimately ended with him setting my apartment on fire with me and my kids inside. That was in October 2019. I have a lifetime restraining order and my divorce was finalized in March 2020. Here's the problem... I'm lonely af and find myself missing the good times I had, missing companionship, and missing my ex-husband. I find myself crying all the time. At 38 I've been in a committed relationship or married to someone for 20 years. I'm so lost. My kids are 18 and 17 and I  just had a baby 8 months ago. Instead of being able to enjoy my newest blessing, I can't help but think about how hard life is alone...although it was hard living in the marriage too...
Like I said, it's a lot. Just needed to get it out b4 the depression gets the best of me",1
"Hi everyone tomorrow is sentencing. I will be reading my statement in person. I’m a nervous wreck. Any tips on keeping it together? I loved and still at times love him. He beat me, held me hostage at knife point and tried to kill me.. however I still will probably always love him. I just don’t know what to expect for tomorrow. I haven’t seen him since the incident he’s been in jail. Anyone know what it’ll be like seeing your abuser for the first time after incident and then going to prison. I’m so scared and nervous I’ve never stepped foot in a court room before. I just feel so sad. I keep reading my statement out loud to practice and I can’t get through it without crying so hard.",1
"Sorry for the long post just needing some advice 
I keep finding myself coming back to my abuser and I can’t figure out why I feel deep in my heart it’s because of our kids I’ve left many times the last time I left I got my own place when the lease ended I came back we’ve always kept in touch and in the beginning I remained strong about it being just about our kid’s but after him begging over and over I gave In and here I am again it’s been 4 months since I’ve moved back in he hasn’t physically touched me like before but he will start random little arguments then not talk to me for days idk what I do wrong I’m tired of trying to please this man all I wanted was my girls to grow up with both parents in the home and I truly believe I’ll never find another man that will love my kids like I do and like he does this is mentally draining I’m just looking for some advice will this ever end we will ever be a normal couple ? Has anyone’s partner every truly changed or am I just being stupid I’ve been dealing with this for 4 years now",1
"Hi. I’m new to the group. 
I don’t even know where to start. I was in my first ever domestic assault last night. He not only attacked me being 32 weeks pregnant, but also hit my oldest. I got home from the hospital this afternoon and All I want to do is cry. I don’t want to cry in front of my kids. But right now I don’t feel I can be strong at all. I feel like I have failed as a mom and it’s my fault. I don’t know what to do or how to handle it . I feel numb all ove",1
I recently 5 days ago reported my girls father of 4 years for Domestic violence he has been using meth and drinking cheating and I am a recovering alcoholic and addict also a mother to a 1 year old and a 2 month old and help take care of his 5 children.. I didnt know what to do or how to file a restraining order I was a day late he filed one before me claiming I was mentally unstable and saying I wanted to drown my girls after he found out I filed a police report for the abuse. I had to turn my girls over to DHS in which they are still in a foster home while he still got to keep his other 5 children in the home and lied said he was clean but gave a dirty UA for meth. He is playing victim acts one way to people and his family but then acts like he hates me. I am so confused as to how me turning in my abuser turned to me losing my girls but I am doing everything I need to get them back hopefully before Christmas or new years being I did a mental health assessment and of course nothing wrong with me. Im just reaching out hoping someone has the same story and advise I just need support.,1
"Hi I am new to this group. Just need some advice and support etc. I have just finished a 3 year relationship with someone I had 2 children with. I have taken out a non molestation order and dealing with the police over various assaults on me. Hes emotionally abused me also by endlessly cheating, throwing me out the house and hiding my keys, staying in awful moods with me for days on end. I am finally free from it which is all I ever wanted. And now that I am and it is the best outcome for me and my children I just feel so empty and upset. I am still wondering what hes doing and thinking about him, it hurts and I don't want to. What is the best way to get over this and when are these sad thoughts going to pass? I am not dealing with heartbreak well and I shouldn't really be heartbroken i should be glad it is over with",1
"Im new here. Just want to tell a little bit about my story. For the past year I've been in a horrible relationship. He use to hit on me, choke me, and has even tried to kill me. A few months ago he went to jail and against my better judgement I decided to forgive him and still be there for him hoping he would change. He did change a little bit. He hasn't hit me since he has been home, but his mouth has stayed the same. I swear his words hurt way more than his hands ever have. I use to cut myself because made me feel relief and satisfaction. Just recently I started cutting again just to feel better. I know that sounds crazy but I can't explain it. It went from cutting my arms to cutting my face. I dont feel like myself. Ive never experienced this before and I feel like I am losing the battle. I have no one to talk to because I dont want anyone to know I go through this. When i try to talk to him he yells at me and blames everything on me. Im to the point now where I dont know what to do",1
"My husband drinks and gets mean. I try n keep quiet but he knows the words that will draw blood and too often I lose control and talk back, which only angers him more. He's choked me before, twice. He's mostly just mean n insulting. He breaks things and urinates around the room. We live in a camper and there's no where for me to go to get away. I have dogs too and they get scared. He wrecked my car in February driving drunk. Now I'm isolated here with very little interaction with others. I work for his family business and his parents live near but prefer to ignore his actions. I've tried to go to them wth no luck. I have health issues that have been ignored because he accuses me of being a hypochondriac. I can't take this much more... standing up to his bullying only infuriates him.",1
"I want to leave my husband so bad, I configured the perfect plan until I discovered all shelters around me  are full.  It’s been over a year now enduring this with him, I am starting to drift away into a puddle of hopelessness. I feel empty and mentally depleted. I ask myself.. Will this ever end? Will I ever be at peace again? That feeling you get when you’re stepping into a haunted house and you don’t know what’s going to happen next or when it will happen. That is my everyday normal feeling, the worst feeling I’ve ever felt. And it’s constant. God please help me. I pray 2021 will finally open a door of opportunity for me to leave and start over.  I pray this for myself and all of you that are enduring the same obstacles as me.",1
"I’ve been married to my husband for a year, we’ve been together for three. In that time he’s pulled a knife out on me, pushed me down on the ground several times, called me so many disgusting things and said he’s hated me. I’m still having a hard time accepting that there was marital rape because it wasn’t violent. Even with everything I’ve been though I’m still struggling with leaving him. With everything that’s happened I still love him. We have so many great memories together and it feels almost impossible to let that go. Has anyone else here felt the same way and been able leave? I need to know it’s possible and that I CAN do this.",1
"I broke up with my bf today. I’ve been with this guy one and off for a little over a year and he’s so sweet and attentive. However, He was verbal abusive when he’s drunk and I left him. I gave him a second chance once he got clean. Everything was going great for the last 5 months. I were happy and  we were planning to get married next year. The last month, he drank whiskey once per week and he mostly just got silly drunk. However, yesterday night, he got abusive and threw me against the wall, dragged me out of his house at 11:00pm and locked me out in the cold. I was haft naked, no shoes and nothing on me. I ran to a neighbor’s house and had them called the cops for me. He told the cop I attacked him and he needed to defend himself. The cop said that they can not arrest him and helped me packed. We were not living together so I still have a place to live. When I talked to him this morning, I realize he is an abuser drunk or not. I can’t believe I’m so stupid for not realizing it. It’s not the alcohol, it’s the person. I just need some emotional support to affirm my decision to leave is right and to keep me from being tricked again.",1
"
I need some advice my daughter has been in a very abusive situation, and today was the worse , I swear I can talk to her till iam blue in the face, but she refuses to press charges, she puts restraining  orders against him, but drops  them , so he can see his kids. Tonight he broke a bone under her eye, I'm worried hes going to kill her one day. The cops have tried to talk to her etc. But she wont do anything. My question is what can I do as a mother and grandmother on the sidelines.",1
"I’m worried about a friend, not sure if I’m worrying about nothing or not? 
She has a main boyfriend who’s abusive and she’s looking to dump him. She has a guy she hooks up with fortnightly and she’s on plenty of fish looking for another guy. Her regular guy wants her to gain weight so to piss him off she’s put herself on a strict diet. She’s only eating 450 calories per day. She says she won’t do it for long. Yesterday she brought a tight fitting woollen dress. I said to her you will certainly piss him off wearing that as you look skinny in it. I’ve told her he’s still controlling her if she does the opposite of what he wants as she should choose for herself what to do. She also has type 1 diabeties. She has a bullying friend as well that she keeps saying she will dump but never does. Should I be worried? And how best can I help her?",1
"NEED TO GET OUT! He can be such a monster... and then put on this facade in front of others and my family. He hates my family and any one else that loves me. He tells me my best friend girl friend is in love with me because we’re close. I’ve been friends with her for 14 years. He’s said things I never thought another human being could to someone they loved. He’s hurt me physically. Even while holding out 4 month old daughter at the time. He football tackled me to the floor with her in my arms. He drinks regularly. And I never know how my night is gonna end. I feel constantly scared and nervous all of the time. I’m not allowed to work because another guy could hit on me. Our daughter is starting to hate him.. she’s 4. My beautiful sweet girl is becoming more angry. She deserves everything in the world. I got in a wreck two days ago, totalljny my car. Now I don’t know what to do, he has total control and he’s loving it. I don’t know what to do. Or how to go anywhere if I don’t have a car.. if there is ANY advice you could give me, please please! I beg of you, help me in any way you can with information! I’m fearing for what could happen more and more.",1
I’m in  a bad bad situation I need help! I’m scared to stay at the house! The shit  he dose to me is crazy and I can’t deal with it or the head games no more! I have an appointment with DSS at 11 tomorrow idk what there gonna do but I got police reports for them idk if that will help but I definitely need a restraining order! I don’t wanna go into what he’s doing to me because I’ll just get upset and it took a lot just for me to write this! I need help I can’t loose my job because I have no where to stay and I’m scared of a shelter it’s to cold to sleep out side and I can’t deal with being at the house because of the things he keeps doing!

"Hi I’m new to the group.
If this isn’t allowed to ask then I’m sorry. But I’m just wondering if there’s anyone currently in a domestic violence relationship.
I am. And idk if I’m scared to leave or what. Like I do love  the guy. He can be great. But when he gets violent it can get really bad.
I guess I’m just really looking for someone to talk to. I don’t have a lot of ppl that I can talk to about things.",1
"He held me hostage for 13 hrs, held a knife to my face, beat and suffocated me. He was going to Kill me, I was able to escape. It’s been 4 weeks he’s still in custody. I have a PO. I am struggling so much. The pain hurts everyday that someone that said they loved you and could never live without you would do something like this to me. We were only in a relationship for 4 months but it progressed very quickly. Why do I feel so much guilt, why does it hurt so bad, why do I miss someone that physically hurt me and was going to kill me? I have nightmares and flashbacks and everyday I can physically feel the fear throughout my body when was putting me through everything that night. I loved him so much and he ruined my life. Why is this so difficult. I just want my life back. And I will never get it back.",1
He came over and demanded i let him in or he'd break the door down. I let him in and he proceeded to threaten my life & tell me a restraining order won't help me. There were no marks left and he took off before the police got here. I was scared by his threats and gave a statement. There were no witnesses and the evidence I have I have not turned over. Can they require me to testify? Does it get dropped due to insufficient evidence if I don't continue to cooperate? He's a narcissist & has turned it around on me. Like always. He's threatening to get a restraining order on ME. I was trying to let it go but now Idk if I have to go get 1 first to protect myself from having an unmerited restraining order on me.. plus all the threats to my life maybe I should. I love him tho despite all this. I had left him but started to rethink it. I fear a restraining order will make him FLIP. He's violated no trespass orders b4.,1
He's going to kill me he beat me over a picture my face hurts so bad he kicked me in the back of my head with boots on I'm going to die my noise is broken but i can't go to the hospital I'm dizzy because of the kicks and punches I'm in a lot of pain,1
I’m 19 and so is he as well I have gone through physical abuse while pregnant and mental abuse for 3 years now I have two children with him who both my mom and I are basically raising but I just wnated to ask did anyone else every wish that their abuser was dead I know it’s harsh and I might get terrible comments but I don’t know why I cnat leave and I feel like I’m never gonna be able too so that’s why I always wish that but I was just wondering if anyone else did or if I’m just insane,1
So he found us. Shelters still full. He already bonded himself out. I can’t do this anymore.,1
"I have a stalker. He's my ex now. He kept asking me to meet up with him and I kept refusing. Finally he said he would show up to my house where my kids were if I didn't meet him somewhere else. I met up with him at a gas station and he just kept trying to tell me how much he loves me he sorry he is how badly he wants everything to work out. He pulled me out of my car and tried to force me in the backseat of his car. Then he got mad and choked me and told me if i made a scene he'd kill me before the cops got there. He finally let go and went around to my car and got my purse and phone out. He told me to give him all my money and he'll leave me alone forever and when I refused to own my phone he broke it and threw it. The was monday. Since then he's sent someone to my job to send the message that he said ""hey"" because he knows he's not allowed there anymore and hes messaged a friend about me. I'm so tired of this. Everyone I tell about the situation keeps telling me it's my own fault for meeting him but he literally shows up wherever I am. He doesn't care. I feel like he's going to end up killing me.",1
I ask myself why I tolerate the way he treats/treated me... Bc I would NEVER condone my sister or daughter allowing a man they date to treat them as such. He isnt sorry... he shows no emotion other than anger and self pity for himself. Making himself the victim. I think the majority of us are with men who genuinely have anger issues or hate themselves and we are the closest they have to an outlet so we get their frustrations and anger full force. Are they all monsters? Maybe not. But it isnt just monsters that hurt or even kill... People loose their temper and in a momentary lack of control snap. Last weekend my fiancee slammed on breaks going over 70mph and threw me forward and causing my seatbelt to cut into my chest and snap my head twice-- also almost rolling our car in a ditch. I dont think hes all bad.. but it doesnt matter. He doesnt have to be all bad to hurt me once and end my life. Just my little epiphany today.,1
"So I left the country because he beat me up. Went to my parents. But I haven't been able to break up with him yet. One and a half month ago. He says he did all this because he's having a great conflict with his family. I quit my supermarket job today, because I have two much better jobs that I can do online. I asked him to go to the supermarket I used to work at to return my uniform, etc. He's got absolutely nothing to do. And he almost refused and said maybe. While I have always done the tiniest thing he asked for no matter how Inconvenient it was. He was also a bit bitter. And I feel should be used to that. After we hang up, I felt really bad, like I really don't want to go back to our life. And then I started texting him and asking him if our life is getting any better. And then he got all hurt, and saying I don't understand him that he feels so despaired by his family, and I don't feel him, and I am just looking for reasons to fight,and I don't appreciate all the effort he puts in our relationship. What do you think ladies?",1
"I just got out of an abusive relationship. He punched me in the face lastnight and left me on the floor. Thankfully nothing broke but I've got facial and skull contusion and it's very hard to eat or open my mouth or even smoke my cigarette 
I didn't want to call the cops but my friend did anyway and he's sitting in jail....and I feel guilty and like it's my fault....he was drunk and irrational. 
I'm hurting and not sure how to process this. I've been in an abusive relationship before but it wasn't this physical. 
I wanted to be with him....I loved him....I feel like this is my fault and that I'm the enemy and will be hated....I don't know what to do. Anybody been in this position?",1
"My abuser beats me up  very week. Last night he beat me up because I wanted to sleep at my moms house with my son and because I didn't show any emotions during sex.
Half of my hair is missing.
I have scars all over my face and body that won't go away. Please recommend some home remedies to get rid of marks on my body. I'm saying home remedies because I can't afford to buy anything because I'm dependent on him.",1
This morning he stole my money and i told him to give it back. He called 911 and tried saying i was beating him and to help him. In the back ground i was yelling at him to give me back my money and that i wasnt hitting him that i wanted my money back. I put my hand in his pocket to get it back and he bit me while still on the phone with the police. He then punched me in the face many times then left the house. When the police came i told them what happened and that i didnt hit him. I filed a domestic report. The cop is pressing charges. They havent found him yet. Im scared to go home. Did i do the right thing? Or should i have kept quiet for my safety? i went to my methadone clinic but im scared to go home.,1
He’s telling me he won’t leave unless I give him full custody of our daughter or he is taken out in cuffs. He threatened to kill me again last night and said he has other people ready and waiting to do it for him if something happens to him. I don’t know what to do. He is going to make my life a living hell until he is gone. I fear he will never leave me alone. I’m in Ohio if that helps.,1
"February 15 this year my boyfriend finally chose not to control his anger and he choked me twice, told me he was going to kill me, he beat my right thigh so bad the doctor said he almost broke my femur. He punched my arm and continued the verbal abuse well after the assault. 
I have been making plans to leave since that day. Unfortunately my elderly father lived with us and that created a mess with my siblings calling elderly services and my brother eventually removed him from my home. 
I’ll post some pictures in the comments. I never thought he would ever go this far. I don’t sleep. I am on anti depressives anti anxiety meds. 
He seriously just came home from his doctor with a script for Xanax and told me he got them for me. 
Today wouldn’t be soon enough to be free from this he",1
I recently had an incident with my husband... second time he put his hands around my throat and slapped me. The first time I passed out. I know there is never an excuse... I just need someone to tell me it's normal to have conflicting feelings. Like I know I need a divorce. I got a protection order and am pressing charges...  but my heart still cares about him and what happens to him even though I don't want to. I'm just struggling with my emotions and thoughts. It's hard not to answer his calls or messages.,1
"I mentally cannot take this man anymore. . He is a abusive narcissistic alcoholic. . He complains about the kids simply playing, sometimes blows up, is always throwing divorce at me and how much he doesn't want to be there but he will not leave. . Forcing me, my 2 children, and the one we share to endure it. . My 11 year old daughter cannot even go to the bathroom without him yelling because she is in there. . We have one bathroom. . I started rented the house we live in 4 and a half years ago. . Everything is in my name. . He told me to quit my job while I was pregnant with our now 2 year old. . Yells at me about not having a job but not giving me the support I need to get one. . So I started home health care with my mother. . I only work 2 days a week to alternate with my mom so I have someone to watch the kids. . But that ain't good enough. . I dont know, my mind is just all over the place.",1
y first boyfriend alienated me from my friends and family. He got me addicted to Heroin and he and his mother tried to turn me out . They forced me to work in a massage parlor untill I was violently raped. My ex was verbally and emotionally abusive. He almost strangled me to death when I finally stood up for myself. I left after that got sober and went back to my family. I have attracted many men since that I found later were also very violent thank god they did not hurt me. I am currently in a long term relationship with a good man that I thought I loved. He was a abused by an alcoholic father. He has trouble showing emotions toward me and I feel like he is just using me for sex but I stay because he would never lay hands on me. My past experiences with men have left me with no self esteem and haunted. I am afraid to leave this man because I feel safe and I am bipolar but I don't just want to be a sex object anymore.,1
"I saw something on his phone that I didn't appreciate.  He was talking to a female that he know has caused problems between us in the past because before we got together he was having sex with her and if I ever brought someone around like that he would lose his mind. When I confronted him this is what he did to me,  he broke my phone, spit in my face and choked me. I got all of these messages this morning and I simply told him what he did proved he's guilty of something. I need advice badly. How do I stay away from this monster? I'm really not doing well right now I'm angry and just feel anger but I know when that loneliness hits It's gonna be hard for me not to contact him. Any advice would help... I'm really alone and nobody knows what I'm going through because I'm ashamed and embarrassed.",1
"I left my relationship and then he started offering to get help, to change, to be better and began to beg for me.  Cry and tell me he’s broken and he can’t believe I don’t want him. I moved out, but feel the urge to go back. He’s convinced himself in seeing someone else, he’s threatibg to drive around our town to see me with whoever he’s convinced himself I’m with. Threatibg to show up to my job, but worst of all threatibg to possibly harm himself. Do I run back? I’m so confused. He’s a narcissist and abusive. I feel free but also such a knot in my stomach. Please, I need advice.",1
"It was so stupid, but out of rage, he grabbed a paper towel that he had cleaned up raw chicken juice with, and shoved it in my face, literally rubbing it all over my face. My kids were scared...and there's nothing I can do about it. I keep looking for cheap transitional apartments for women and children in my area but honestly I can't even afford that and I don't have a car. The cops have failed me so many times I don't dare call them and this isn't that big of a deal I guess. I don't even know what to do anymore.",1
"I called him a monster. He took great offense. 
We’ve had more than a decade of a healthy loving relationship with communication. The last 2 plus years it’s like something changed. We’re working at home due to Covid. Home too much together. I know he’s not cheating. He’s just angry a lot. So, I can’t be angry without him wrestling me to the floor? I’m so hurt inside. I want the old him back. 
I just wanted to tell someone. Thank you for listening.",1
"Hi I was forced out of our home he was still threatening And harassing me, he somehow got custody of our two young daughters, I'm ordered to pay him over 1,715.00. I've had two lawyers quit on me, my new lawyer is not calling me back. I'm so confused and I feel so violated. I've been to the court the police station, as a woman I feel so violated and feel like no one is listening",1
"Is it considered rape/abuse if you don't want to have sex but he keeps forcing you to and gets mad if you don't and starts arguments accusing you of sleeping with someone elsebecause you don't want to be pleasurable to him? We've been together ten years, he's 48 and I'm 30, and he's made me have sex with him even when I didn't want to. We've even physically fought sometimes because I didn't want to have sex with him or he would accuse me of sleeping with somebody else and fight me if he felt like it wasn't wet enough or tight enough for his liking. But when you're forcing someone to want to have sex it's not going to be the same as if she willingly wanted to do it. I'm so tired of feeling sick to my stomach everytime I lay down in my own bed. I literally feel like I want to throw up right at this very moment. I want out of this relationship so bad I can taste it on my tongue. But I'm broke, with no support and I have a six and a fourteen year old that I'm responsible for. So I'm trapped until I can find a safe way out of this life he's created for me.",1
"The abuse doesn’t happen very often. Maybe once or twice a year, when we’re in the middle of an argument. He punched me once in the face in December. He slept on the couch for a month and slowly things went back to normal with stipulations of course. He just threw a phone at my face, while my two year old was cuddled up on me, and my eye is swollen. I made him leave the house or I was going to call the police. We don’t speak to either of our parents. We currently live 12 hours away from all my family, and planned to move back in August. I don’t have a car, I don’t have a job, I have one daughter and two large dogs. I know I’m not in current danger right now. But I know I can’t keep living my life in this cycle. We’ve been together 7 years, and I basically only married him because I gave my virginity to him and kept hoping the happily ever after would happen. I had an abortion early in our relationship. I deeply regret it and it has destroyed who I am. The decision to have my daughter came from a suicide attempt. On the surface, we look happy and just young people trying to figure out life. Very few people know. I’m currently in my last year of college online and told myself it would be my escape plan, but I don’t know how to do another year of this now that I’ve pretty much decided I’m done trying to save this.",1
"I really need advice on what some of you have done after you got away and the backlash you took financially/credit. 
My ex abuser i was with for over 8 years had so much control over our finances i was being so used. I was so stupid and im suffering so much with debt he put me in... i am now being sued 3 years after getting out (& barley survived) which he got charged with domestic violence and assault and then after gruleing court Bullshit (sorry for my language but the abuse continued into the court shit with continuances and lasted about 7 months till everything was done (criminal charges & final protection order hearing) 
Basically im still to THIS day SUFFERING and it never ends and now being sued for a credit card he took out in my name. I need help. So much",1
I'm seriously struggling...the abuse I suffered was mostly emotional...he was physical with me a total of 3x after this 3rd time I left my home and I have been staying at my moms...he keeps wanting to reconcile...he calls texts emails...says he wants to try therapy for himself and as a couple...I want to be done but part of me can't seem to let him go ...not sure if thats out of fear or love...I feel really stupid for wanting to stay,1
"This is my first time posting just felt I had to vent, my ex kicked me out in December with my daughter who's almost two. When he realized I wasn't coming back he filed an emergency order saying I was trying to take her out of state. Wich is ridiculous she has special needs her doctors are here i would never do that.
Fast forward to today after months of the lawyer his mommy paid for attacking me. I couldn't take it anymore I signed an agreement making my restraining order void so I could be with my daughter. But he has to be there or he comes to my house with her  this is insane. I stayed there last night. He got wasted. I made the mistake of saying something this morning and got pushed, my foot caught on the older kids bunk bed. Anyway I have a bloody knot on my head and he has my baby. He's 40 im 24 . I just keep thinking I did this to myself he didn't take my future I let him have it",1
"Does anyone else still have to share custody with an abuser? If so, do they still try to emotionally abuse and control you through your children?  I’m struggling with this today.  I feel myself on the verge of an emotional breakdown.  I put everything I have into being a good mom.  She is my heart and my world. He also finds a way to reduce me to feeling like I’m terrible or a toxic mother.",1
I am having such a hard time moving on. It has been 7 months and I miss him. He beat me and he tried to burn his house down with me in it. Why does it hurt so much? I keep asking myself what could I have done to make things better. He always made me feel like everything was my fault. He still controls me. He has my things and will not let me have anything back. Please I'm begging you to tell me how to move on with my life. Please,1
Well he gets home from work in half an hour and then I will be locked in my bedroom again because apparently I am a thief and a piece of shit because I took $50 out of his wallet to get my insulin and that was apparently his storage money to pay for his storage unit which he did not tell me at all and now I'm a bitch in a cunt and a thief and a whore and I have to stay locked in the bedroom while he's home with only four bathroom breaks a day until I come up with his money which of course I have absolutely no way of doing I don't know anybody he has taken all my friends and all my family from me so this is a real nightmare I don't understand how some men can be so cruel I would gladly work if he would let me I don't understand what he expects me to do he gets home very soon so I just wanted to at least let somebody know what's going on with me in case I don't come back out of my bedroom please don't judge me I have nowhere else to go I just wanted to tell my story for a minute,1
Hello. I recently left my ex about a month ago. I have been trying to get a restraining order against him and found out yesterday that it got denied due to lack of proof and details. He was careful to never leave bruises and I never once reported him before. Now I feel like I am hitting a brick wall and am contemplating whether or not it is even worth it to keep trying for the restraining order. I'm just so tempting to give up.,1
I need some help 10 days after the attack I can't cope I hate him for what hes done to me but this time its different he tried to kill me but I miss him hes on remand on a abh charge got to go to crown court on 1st March I keep thinking I'm going to put him in jail for quite a long time can I really do that to him he was so scared of going back in and now ive put him there I just wish it hadn't happened and he was still here I miss him so much and all I do every day is cry this is a nightmare I don't even want to be here anymore,1
I spent almost 9 years of my life in fear.. and torment.. hiding bruises.. making excuses and flat out covering for someone who was stripping layers of me away each day. I attempted to numb my pain with my drug of choice... I journaled my prayers for the words I could hardly speak.. I #know God heard each one and HIS answer came in what was meant to completely break me.... but HE used it to push me through.. Each step of this journey has not come easy.. some day’s I still struggle with memories but I am no longer a victim of fear and I’m no longer a victim of Domestic Violence.. I’m a #survivor.. I’m an over comer and I’m here to speak 🗣 for those who still can’t!! Domestic violence is real.. and it’s extremely difficult to leave. In most cases the violence becomes intensely more dangerous once the person has left the relationship.. so each journey is unique. Please don’t give up on them if you know someone in a situation like this.. as I said it takes tremendous courage to leave! Be a voice for the voiceless.. raise awareness... the more who know the more can help.. when we bring #Light into darkness the darkness has to flee,1
"So when my husband and I drink I get defensive (I actually stand up for myself) he gets offensive!!!
He’ll literally berated me because I refuse to give him sex because of the way he treats me, he will literally berate me over anything, he’ll tell me I’m easily replaceable by any whore on Pine street (lewiston Maine well known prostitution site) 
The other night he physically attacked me and I kneed him in the balls (he had me pinned to the bed, I’ve been raped and he’s sexually frustrated, I had to protect myself) 
I always said if it became physical it would be EASY to leave I now know that is a LIE 
PLS ladies set an esclape plan and stick to it
I have mine set 
I won’t give details cause honestly I don’t know how much control he has",1
"Why am I such a fool? Emergency restraining order, sure, but I never press the charges. My friends and family are fed up with my stupidity for not putting him away. Setting here now, nose busted, throat to sore to swallow, house full of holes from a pry bar car window bashed in, and I set here doing nothing just glad to be alone for the moment. Why can't I take that step and remove him from my life?",1
"2 weeks ago he started a silent treatment. Stonewalling I guess….Usually I react immediately but not this time. It’s different now. I did not react, apologize, or give him what he wanted. He tried another tactic and I did not react. We have spoke a few times in these 2 weeks very briefly about our daughter. The tactic he is trying now is deciding he does not want to go to church on Sundays. The past two sundays 😂 as the whole household is getting dressed up and ready to go he’s pouting and staying behind 😂 still I’m not reacting and only being calm. In 4 1/2 years I have always reacted but this is the longest I have not. He is losing his power slowly. I have my heart set on leaving this abuser but it’s not easy 😢 so many things to factor into it. I’m also very afraid.",1
I left my ex almost 7 years after 2 children of pure physical sexual and verbal abuse he was found guilty! Well the last 6 years he has been physically verbally and sexually abusing my children... cps indicated him in it... yesterday we had court as I stopped sending them he filed for custody... the courts didn't want to hear any of the sexual assault didn't even care and gave him residential parent just to punish me for not following he stopped his alcohol testing and was thanked for doing it as long as he did after failing 11tests and telling lies with proof... I need all the thoughts prayers and any support... if anyone wants to hear more details let me know I will not sit quietly and hide what this monster has done to me and my children and what the court is allowing him to do,1
"My boyfriend hit me again this am due to my smart mouth. Why can’t I just keep my mouth shut? I keep antagonizing him. It’s all my fault really.  
He’s hit 8 times and spit on 5. He verbally & emotionally abuses me but he says I do all that to him & he’s just responding to what I say. 
He’s been pushing me away. My friends are over an hour to see. His friends are 10 min away and he tells me to get a life. He wants more time with friends and he says I’m up his ass all the time. I don’t make friends easily and tend to be alone with my major depressive disorder. That makes it worse. He wants to hang out with his mom & best friend. Really?! 
My heart is in so much pain I cry all the time or become livid. If I kept my mouth shut this wouldn’t happen. 
Oddly enough I love him. I’ve NEVER dealt with anyones shit in a relationship. Why now Is beyond me. Plus when we fight he won’t have sex with me. We rarely do and it’s almost 2 years together. 
This makes me feel so ugly, fat, worthless, alone, livid, unloved and feel that people really don’t care. 
We have 2 puppies and I can’t leave or I will lose them forever. I would rather make sure my pups are ok & deal with this. Besides my pain is too much to deal with anymore.",1

"I have not felt safe enough to go back home after I finally had enough of the emotional, financial, mental, and physical abuse this morning at around 2am when I kicked Narcissist boyfriend (21M) out who had been living with me since April.

I know he is lurking around my apartment complex waiting for me to come back (so he can come knock on my door, harass me, etc.) because he’s done this before. 

His stuff is still at my apartment which I am more than willing to give but only if an officer is with us watching. 

He has literally laid outside the front door of my apartment for hours without leaving when his name isn’t on the lease and he technically isn’t even allowed on property (said directly from my apartments manager)

What can I do to finally get him out of my life for good when I’m scared to even go home.",1
"So without going into too much detail, my friend who is married, and has a child with her spouse, has been getting severely abused for years. My friend is an immigrant and is unemployed, so she is afraid to call for help in the case that her husband is arrested and she is left with no money. I’m sure there are some programs in place to support her and her child, but I have no idea. Does anyone know what would happen in this situation? Thank you for your help.",1

I hate it, I’m not even sure if I’ll be able to finish school, my life has been flipped completely. I mean, it’s not like abusing my mum has been a recent thing for him. I regret calling the police, I can’t help to think that if I didn’t I’d be much happier, able to finish school, and I’d be able to finally sleep without worrying. It’s so selfish but i just wish she could of left him sooner- because she had the choice to do so without things getting like this.",1

I tried to sit down next to him laying down on the couch. He kicked me. So hard I flew. He made this angry face and kicked me in the pelvis. I almost went threw out coffee table. I screamed so loud that he grabbed me before my body crashed into the coffee table. I would have been seriously hurt. I was injured where my spine and pelvis meet. I just laid down after because within seconds he was snoring on the couch after this.

He’s literally said to me “sometimes when I look at you I just hate you so much I can’t stand it” but I STILL FEEL BAD. WHYYYYYYYY

I just wish he’d tell me to leave. Or cheat on me so I’d have a ‘reason’ to leave. I’m so stupid. I hate my self.

we went out drinking, got into an argument over me saying his friend is immature because he punched a random guy in the face for no reason.

we got back home and he was pretty much black out drunk and freaked out on me, said his best friend comes first blah blah blah. i got mad and wanted to leave his house so i tried to get an uber. he grabbed my face and squeezed my face and said i’m not leaving. i kept trying to walk out of his bedroom and he was blocking the door. he then grabbed me by the throat and threw me on the bed. pinned me down with my face smushed down on the mattress and he laid on top of me and told me i’m not leaving. i started crying because he held me down by the throat for at least 2 minutes. when he got off me he was blocking the door and wouldn’t let me out. we went to sleep. the next morning i brought it up and he said “you have a good boyfriend and you need to realize that. you deserved it. i’d never hit you but i felt threatened because you wanted to leave and i didn’t want you to. plus you probably liked it anyways”",1

I was only 5 when they started dating and I didnt see the abuse until I came across the word gaslighting one day.

Hes extremely narcissist and loves to gaslight people. He always says that we are lying and only he remembers situations the right way. He has everything in his name, my moms name is on nothing. (They bought a house together and my mom pays for 70% of the bills). Hes the only one that can drive after convincing my mom she cant drive anymore. (She has some physical disability but nothing that limits her to driving.)

If we dont follow his rules and his laws he gets extremely upset and starts yelling. It goes on and on. I've never seen him hit her but I've witnessed the time he locked and cornered her in the bathroom because he got upset with her. Hes also threatened to shove my brothers head through the wall and to not let me eat for a week just because I couldnt finish a jello cup.",1

My short term memory has gotten progressively worse and I wake up in chronic pain every morning. He manipulated me so bad when it happened that I never made a report because I was scared and somehow he made me feel like I deserved it even though I didn’t do anything to provoke him. I wake up everyday in so much pain and I can’t help but cry. I’m only 25 and I can barely turn around without gasping because the pain feels so bad.

I’d be very grateful if you could provide me with information for organizations that could help me, I am a stay at home mom and my husband did not let me finish my college degree, so I don’t have any means of making money. Today he kicked me out of the house and locked the doors, I don’t even have a place to stay at night.",1

I just confronted my husband for being very rude when we had family company over. He isolated himself and when the company left I told him it was very rude and I was upset about it. Fast forward ten minutes of him escalating and calling me names and making threats and he hauled off and punched me. I am so fucking pissed off and don’t know what to do!,1
He always blamed me for antagonizing him. This time I was sitting on the bed holding the baby telling him to leave. He walked over and slapped me hard then he came back and choked me. He says Hod says he's right and I'm in the wrong.,1
"Hi everyone, I hope you are all doing well. A family relative of mine was in a domestic violence situation a week ago- she was pushed against the kitchen counter and her partner held his fists up to her and threatened her. She was shaken and now feels ready to report the incident but is currently unsure about pursuing a divorce or separation. She just wants the police to be aware the incident happened and have it on record. She is confused if this is possible and if so, what should she tell them? Thank you so much.",1
"I need to escape my abusive family. I live in Iraq and there’s no law to protect me here and the authorities won’t help me. I need to escape the country because if I stay here they will kill me.

Please if you know any organizations, people or any information share it with me. I’m desperate and I don’t know what to do.",1
"Are there any books written for the partners of DV/ abusive relationship survivors? Books written for people experiencing it are insightful but I’m looking for something to help understand and support rather than self help. I tried searching but didn’t find much, which strikes me as odd.",1
Im a 24-year-old yemeni national. Born and raised in UAE. My father has been abusing us ever since my sister escaped this house. We did try to escape but by law he is our sponsor and he can cancel our residency visa and deport us back to Yemen. Any advice on dealing with this?,1
"My abusive boyfriend likes to blow up my phone with all these cruel messages while I’m at work, and just in general. I always reply, but it starts to affect me, and I get really upset and start crying while I’m at work. I feel like if I don’t answer it’s going to get worse. Should I just be ignoring all his messages? Or is that unsafe to do so?",1

"Please don’t beat me up for not leaving yet, I’m getting the courage too. It’s really hard to work up to. He held his hands around my neck and when I said I was scared he’d kill me he slapped me across the face several times and told me he would. He slapped me, punched me and held a pillow over my face for several minutes. I’m really struggling emotionally",1
"I finally got in to see a therapist and described some of my concerns with my stbx. He said that it was absolutely abuse and that he was required by law to report it.

Has anyone been through this? What happens next. I’m afraid this is going to make everything worse.",1
Yesterday I heard screaming from my driveway and ran outside to find my neighbor holding her ear and crying. Her husband slapped her while they were arguing and Nearly burst her eardrum! I stayed with her and her daughter while my husband told her’s to get lost. Her husband was acting like nothing was wrong and everything was totally normal. Eventually he took off and hasn’t been back since. I want to reach out to her and support her and was thinking of providing her with some resources like my cell phone number and maybe the DV hotline. I also want to let her know I would be willing to be a witness for her if she needed it. But I also don’t want to overstep and make her feel uncomfortable. What’s the best way to support her while being delicate and respectful??,1
"I posted here a few weeks ago, asking for advice as a newly married couple. It only gets worse. This time he slammed my head into the window while he was driving, said horrible unspeakable things, called me a cunt, a stupid fuckinf bitch and every horrific thing in the book. He proceeded to grab me by my neck, and push me as hard as he physically could into the door. I don’t know what to do. In my culture it’s unacceptable to divorce. I love him with my whole heart but I’ve married a monster. I’m in physical pain. I need someone to talk to, I can’t tell anyone in real life",1
"I get abuse by my dads partner. Nearly everyday I get abused, shouted at or anything, even for the smallest thing. My dads on my side kind of, it’s my dads partner (step mom)that is the issue.

I used to be in a physically abuse relationship for around a year where i was beaten alot. Recently someone slapped me and i froze for a few seconds and started panicking and thinking about my prior relationship before i calmed down. I havent been to therapy or diagnosed with anything so I was wondering if it was related to my abuse and what it was if so.,1
"I need help on making the plan of leaving, i don't know who can help me to plan it cause i know there's like social workers or something bthat help you plan it, crate a safe and logical plan to leave, there's even a woman on tiktok i saw that do that with women but i don't know what or where should I look for",1
"Is there a physically disabled parent out there who left their abusive spouse successfully? If so, how??

I can provide background if needed, but to rehash everything is emotionally painful. It is definitely abuse on his part.",1
"I am just a teenager, my friends are all just teenagers in quarantine. I have a friend who's being sexually harassed by her stepfather. She has a mother and a younger sister. She's been suicidal for years, and has been cutting herself. We keep telling her to report to the police or at least tell her mother but she's scared. He threatens her saying if she reported, he would kill her family. (I personally think he's just barking) We really don't know what to do. She doesn't want to report due to

"He's hit me before in the past. Maybe I was being a bitch, but then he raised his hand at me as if to hit me, and I flinched rrally bad. Then he laughed at me amd called me a bitch",1
"Me and my partner had been dating for about 2 years and everything was perfect. Then he began to censor what I wore, if I did my makeup or not, who I spoke to or hung out with (friends and fam), my financial spending, how I spoke, etc.  After came the name calling (stupid, idiot, retard, bitch, slut, whore) which he said I deserved for acting in such manner. I wanted to leave him but I went through a loss in my family and I didn’t want to go through another so I stayed. soon after the abuse became physical and he would hit me, pull my hair, throw me down things, etc. Which he would then apologize for and say he was sorry and that he loved me. I tried and tried to leave and we would somehow end up talking for hours and yet again I’d give him another chance. Then one day he hit me so bad that he left me bruised I called the cops on in fear of losing my life. The cops came and he was arrested. I documented everything and worked with the cops. I also became aware of past violent criminal felonies he has (including a fb case with his ex gf). He still says he loves me and that he wants to work things out and I honestly love him too but deep in my souls I know I need to leave him no matter how much it hurts. I have a supportive friend and family circle, therapy, and a good job In a field that I love however with all the support I don’t understand why it is so hard for me to let him go. I guess I just always wanted him to love me how I loved him and wish he would change for me. I can’t grasp the fact that the person I’ve loved the most in my life could be so mean and al I do is blame myself for not being better or keeping him less angry.",1
"So my mom is with an abuser who is very narcissistic, very insecure and bipolar sometimes he is so nice and funny and the other times he is super violent and crazy he had physically abusive my mother very badly and I woke up in the middle of it while he was beating her this left me PSTD am pretty sure for life. And he's doing and done so much other stuff for example left an app on my mother phone where he can see whos shes texting and what shes doing . I can not call the police because she's just going to deny it so I have no clue what to but just keep trying to convince her to leave.

All I am asking for is support and advice thank you!",1
"I’l try keep this as short as I can. 

My mum is severely depressed- has been for years. She’s been on loads of antidepressants that don’t seem to work for her. About 2 years ago she split up with her boyfriend and attempted suicide by overdose. I believe this was a cry for help and she wanted medical professionals to see how desperate she was. They just sent her home that day. Fast forward to today, my mum has been on again off again with this ex boyfriend. He’s no good for her, he’s a coke addict, buys illegal Valium and not to mention extremely abusive (only physical once that I know of). Anyways I’m getting off track, today I get a call she's been taken into hospital on another suicide attempt and again they send her home with a leaflet filled with telephone numbers to help her. I’m beyond frustrated and upset at the lack of help she’s getting. Also I called the police on the ex who was in the house when I got in (smashed mirror/tv, blood all over my mums clothes and a clump of hair that had been pulled out my mums head). The police were no help either they just removed him from the premises and said to me we’ve all had a boyfriend no one else likes. I’m really struggling myself and want her to get help. She was so close to getting kept in hospital today which I felt she would have needed and wanted but alas.

Extra details- I live in the UK so NHS services for mental health aren’t the best",1
"The cycle of ongoing violence came out recently at her birthday party and was openly discussed with her friends.

At party said it was ""100% over"" and he is a ""fucking psycho"".

It also came out that she has a codeword to call for help from a friend.

She took him back a few days later and told me she knows it's ""toxic"", that she always questioned why women stay in abusive relationships but she loves him.

So I'm hoping that she is close to leaving him.  The fact she can see some truths but isn't yet ready to fully accept them gives me hope.",1
"He drank a quarter gallon of alcohol within 24 hours. He quit nicotine a week and 2-3 days ago. He's been all over the place, not stable. Not respecting my boundaries but that's nothing new. He's blaming everything on quitting the nicotine but I know he is making the conscious choice to disrespect me (and other people), to not think about my feelings. He wanted to listen to music WITH me for hours (I do not like this) and after two hours of this (and it being 12am) I tried to let him know I was ready for bed. He said to me ""I feel like I should punch you in the face."" Because he could tell I did not want to listen to music anymore. That made me feel sick to my stomach and obviously scared. He pushed it for another 2 hours, making me do things I did not want to do. From 10pm to 3am he berated me, a lot of it being drunken stupidness and calling me names, but none the less making me feel terrible and not allowing me to have a choice wether or not I wanted to be around him. I hate feeling powerless like this. No one stands up to him, he won't accept it if someone actually does stand up to him. it's always everyone else's issue or fault. I'm so tired of this and want to move on from this relationship as I know he won't ever change and I've already wasted 5 years of my life being with him and trying to work with him on his issues. I'm tired of my life being consumed by him and his issues.",1
"I was doing well with no contact but I'm breaking down. I'm just so idk alone and honestly, I'm not seeing the good in people like it seems everyone is just a really crapy person maybe I'm the weird one expecting others to be kind to one another.he was very abusive but he did get better it wasn't as much as it use to be idk my insurance won't cover therapy so here I am",1
"So I feel ashamed because I kept giving my partner chance after chance.
 We've had a chaotic and very fast relationship with multiple moves and i already have children and we have had a child together as well, in a small period of time. 
His outbursts and rants usually happen when alcohol and drugs are involved, but how many times can you forgive one person? 
Every time police are called he gets worse, everything is always all my fault, he won't take responsibility for his actions and hates being held accountable. 
I feel ashamed I stupidily let him back.
Yesterday was the worst, I was choked thrown and dragged by my hair. I did not retaliate as I feel he wanted me to hit back.
Police have put an order on so he cannot come back to the house. I feel relieved. 
What us wrong with me",1
"Husband (29M) and I (25F) have been together 7 years. He never ever showed signs of being abusive until this last year. About a year ago we got into a huge fight that has taken all this time to recover from, because we both did and said things we regret badly.

Lately his temper flies off the handle. It started out a few months ago when I went to bed during a fight because I didn’t want to argue. He came in the bedroom, flipped on the lights, and flipped the mattress over while I was on it and said you are going to fucking talk to me.

Now he is gotten into the habit of leaving the house whenever I try to express my feelings. He says I am a manipulative lying bitch. So I stand in front of the door because years ago that would have worked because he wouldn’t have put his hands on me. Now he says move or I’ll move you and he grabs my shoulders and throws me in the floor. He has done this several times. 

This morning we got into a fight over something he misunderstood that I said. I followed him into the kitchen because he wouldn’t quit walking away from me. He told me he was going to hurt me if I didn’t go away. I stayed because I didn’t believe him. He put his arm around my neck and said how do you like that? I hit him because I was defending myself. 

Then he told me if I ever yelled again I would be picking my teeth off the floor.

I know it sounds like the no brainer option would be to leave, but I wish I knew why he was so angry. Why he has no tolerance for me anymore. Up until last year he was my best friend and would hurt any man who he ever saw lay hands on a woman. He has become the kind of person he hates. Also, I always get reeled back in... he was just cuddling up to me last night saying you’re my favorite person ever and Im so glad you are mine. Stuff like that. Kissing all over me. He will do that for about two weeks at a time and then become a monster again. My emotions are all over the place because during those two weeks of change I always think things are going to go back to normal. Like they were before our big fight a year ago. 

I don’t know what to do. I want to make it work but his temper is out of control. I have a brand new iPhone 11 and he got mad because I was on it one time and threw it across the room and shattered it. There are several holes in our walls. I just don’t know why he’s so violent and destructive now.

Like I said I know the obvious answer is to leave, but I want to believe he is capable of being who he used to be. I want to believe we can be ok again because I do love him so much. I just don’t know what to do.",1
"Can someone help me? I was with my partner for nearly 2 years, for about 10 months i have been trying to leave him but if i do, he parks up outside my house and just sits outside it and i mean for days on end, even sleeps in the car. This is getting too much for me. Im getting fed up of being beat, cheated on and being told im fat and ugly etc. How do i break free from this hell? I don’t even think i love him anymore but i know he wont let me break up with him. i just feel like killing myself is the only way i can break free xx",1
"I’m currently almost a year free of my abusive ex. And 3 years free from the abuse ex before that... I’m still having such a hard time excepting a new man in my life that is truly 100% genuine with his love, respect and care towards me. I’m not sure how to move forward.. any advise?",1
